# Inside the package

A taste of the **Agency** package: CRM and pipeline setup so you can run 5–10 clients cleanly.

## Pipeline stages (example)

The package’s GoHighLevel setup guide uses a simple stage flow you can adapt:

```text
Lead → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Won / Lost
```

Each stage has clear criteria and optional automation (e.g. move to “Proposal sent” when the proposal doc is shared).

## What you get

- **GoHighLevel (and best-of-breed) setup**: One path for all-in-one, another for HubSpot + ClickUp + Zite.
- **Team pricing and revenue strategy**: Price by deliverable and scale without burning out.
- **Operations templates**: Handoff checklists, status reports, and client review templates.
