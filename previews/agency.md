# Inside the package

A technical peek at the **Agency** package: CRM pipeline design and automation so you can run 5–10 clients cleanly.

## How it fits together

The package’s GoHighLevel (and best-of-breed) setup uses a clear flow:

- **Stages**: Lead → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Won / Lost  
- **Criteria** per stage (e.g. “Proposal sent” when the proposal doc is shared)
- **Optional automation**: Move deals between stages on events (form submit, doc link sent, etc.)

You’ll get a stage-by-stage config and example automations so your pipeline matches how you actually sell.

## Pipeline structure (example)

From the package’s GHL setup guide:

```text
Lead → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Won / Lost
```

Each stage has defined exit criteria and optional webhooks or internal automation. The full package includes the exact field set, status names, and where to plug in your proposal and contract templates.
