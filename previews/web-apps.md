# Inside the package

A taste of the **Web Apps** package: structured setup and real implementation steps.

## Environment setup

The package includes step-by-step guides for Stripe and Next.js. Here’s how environment variables are set up in the guides:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
```

Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` so secrets stay local.

## What you get

- **Implementation plans**: Level 1–3 roadmaps so you can go from idea to live SaaS.
