# Inside the Master Bundle

All four packages in one place: **Web Apps**, **Social Media**, **Agency**, and **Freelancing**.

## One snippet from the bundle

The Web Apps Stripe setup (included in the bundle) uses the same pattern you’ll see across platform guides:

```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

Then in your app you load Stripe and mount the Elements provider — the full package includes the exact code and env setup for Next.js.

## What you get

- **145+ hours** of structured content across every path.
- **Same level structure** (Level 1 → 2 → 3) in every package, so you can mix and match.
- **One purchase**: switch between building SaaS, running social, scaling an agency, or freelancing without buying again.

Get the full Master Bundle for every guide, template, and implementation plan.
