# Inside the Master Bundle

A technical peek at **all four packages**: Web Apps, Social Media, Agency, and Freelancing in one place.

## How it fits together

The bundle uses the same implementation pattern across packages:

- **Stripe (Web Apps)** and **PayPal (Freelancing)** for payments; **GoHighLevel / CRM (Agency)** for pipeline; **Metricool and reporting (Social Media)** for client deliverables
- **One level structure**: Level 1 → 2 → 3 in every package, so you can mix and match (e.g. ship a SaaS first, then add agency playbooks)
- **Shared conventions**: Env-based secrets, webhook verification, and step-by-step platform guides so you’re never guessing

You’ll get 145+ hours of structured content, production-ready templates, and implementation plans for every path.

**Revenue focus:** Earning patterns for SaaS subscriptions, client retainers, agency deals, and freelance projects—one bundle, every monetization path.

## One snippet from the bundle

The Web Apps Stripe setup (included in the bundle) uses the same pattern you’ll see in other platform guides:

```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

Then in your app you load Stripe and mount the Elements provider. The full package includes the exact API routes (checkout + webhook), env setup for Next.js, and access-grant logic you can reuse across projects.

## What you get

- **145+ hours** of structured content across every path.
- **Same level structure** (Level 1 → 2 → 3) in every package, so you can mix and match.
- **One purchase**: switch between building SaaS, running social, scaling an agency, or freelancing without buying again.
