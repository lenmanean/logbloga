# Inside the package

A taste of the **Freelancing** package: getting paid and staying protected.

## PayPal and invoicing

The package’s PayPal setup guide recommends using a **Business account** for freelancing:

- **PayPal.Me link** for quick payment requests
- **Invoicing** for formal client work
- **Clear records** for taxes and disputes

Create `.env` or a config file for your PayPal client ID and secret (never commit secrets):

```env
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
```

Use environment variables in your app; the package shows where and how.

## What you get

- **Fiverr and Upwork guides**: Profile, gigs, and proposals that convert.
- **Contract and proposal templates**: Protect yourself and set expectations.
- **First client and direct client acquisition**: Step-by-step outreach and positioning.
