# Inside the package

A technical peek at the **Freelancing** package: getting paid securely and staying protected with contracts and invoicing.

## How it fits together

The package ties payment and protection into one flow:

- **PayPal Business**: PayPal.Me for quick requests, Invoicing for formal work, clear records for taxes and disputes
- **Env-based config**: Store client ID and secret in environment variables; the guides show where to plug them into your app or scripts
- **Contracts and proposals**: Templates that set scope, revisions, and payment terms so you’re protected from day one

You’ll configure a Business account, optional SDK usage for server-side flows, and use the included contract and proposal templates with real clients.

## Config you’ll use

From the PayPal setup guide (never commit secrets):

```env
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
```

Use these in your app or scripts; the package shows where and how. You’ll also get Fiverr/Upwork profile and gig guidance, plus first-client and direct-acquisition steps.

## What you get

- **Fiverr and Upwork guides**: Profile, gigs, and proposals that convert.
- **Contract and proposal templates**: Protect yourself and set expectations.
- **First client and direct client acquisition**: Step-by-step outreach and positioning.

Get the full package for pricing worksheets, premium positioning, and Level 2–3 guides.
