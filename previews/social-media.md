# Inside the package

A technical peek at the **Social Media** package: reporting structure and content systems you can use with clients from day one.

## How it fits together

The package gives you a repeatable reporting flow:

- **Same structure every period**: Summary → Metrics table → Top posts → Recommendations
- **Metricool (and platform) setup**: Connect metrics without guesswork; the guides show where to pull reach, engagement, and top posts
- **One template**: You fill in numbers and copy; the format stays consistent so clients know what to expect

You’ll get the exact report markdown template and a short guide on wiring it to your chosen tooling.

**Revenue focus:** Price your service (retainers, packages), tie reporting to renewals and upsell, and get paid consistently.

## Report template (from the package)

```markdown
## Summary
- Key wins this period

| Reach      | —           | —        |
