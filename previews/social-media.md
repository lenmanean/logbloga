# Inside the package

A taste of the **Social Media** package: reporting and content structure you can use with clients.

## Report structure

The package’s client reporting template uses a clear, repeatable structure:

```markdown
## Summary
- Key wins this period
- One or two sentences for the client

## Metrics
| Metric      | This period | Previous |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Reach      | —           | —        |
| Engagement | —           | —        |

## Top posts
Screenshots or links with short notes

## Recommendations
2–3 next steps aligned to goals
```

Use the same structure every time; only the numbers and copy change.
