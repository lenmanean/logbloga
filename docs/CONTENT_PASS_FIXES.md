# Content Pass — Heading Structure and Cross-References

**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Scope:** Sample per plan — one implementation plan per package (Web Apps, Social Media, Agency, Freelancing) and first two creative frameworks for Level 1 in each package. Checklist: headings (##/###/####), cross-references (relative links, "See the X section"), terminology (Level, package, platform costs, expected revenue, time investment, AI leverage).

## Sample files reviewed

- **Implementation plans:** web-apps-level-1-plan.md, social-media-level-1-plan.md, agency-level-1-plan.md, freelancing-level-1-plan.md
- **Frameworks (Level 1):** idea-generation-framework.md, value-proposition-worksheet.md (Web Apps); niche-selection-worksheet.md, brand-identity-framework.md (Social Media); agency-niche-framework.md, service-package-framework.md (Agency); service-definition-framework.md, portfolio-creation-framework.md (Freelancing)

## Findings

- **Headings:** All sampled files use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections; `####` used where steps or sub-steps are present. No lone h1 without hierarchy. Structure is suitable for TOC and expanded-view search.
- **Cross-references:** Relative links to other in-package files (e.g. [Buffer Setup Guide](buffer-setup-guide.md)) and "from the Templates section" / "Platform Setup Guides" style are present and consistent with [CONTENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](CONTENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md).
- **Terminology:** Level, platform costs, expected revenue, time investment, and AI leverage are used consistently in line with [TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md](TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

## Actions taken

- No structural fixes were required. Content pass confirmed that the sampled files meet the heading and cross-reference standards. A full file-by-file pass can be done in a future iteration if desired.
