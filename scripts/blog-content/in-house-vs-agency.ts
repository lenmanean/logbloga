export const IN_HOUSE_VS_AGENCY_CONTENT = `## It's Not Just the Retainer

Choosing between in-house marketing and a performance agency isn't about salary versus monthly fee. It's about **total cost**, **speed**, and **risk**. Most brands compare the wrong numbers and end up surprised when the real bill arrives. This guide gives you a framework to decide—and to compare apples to apples.


## What In-House Actually Costs

When you hire in-house, the sticker price is only the beginning. You're signing up for a full cost structure that compounds over time.

### Direct costs

You pay **salary** (or multiple salaries for specialists), **benefits** (often 25–35% on top of base), **tools** (ad platforms, analytics, creative software, project management), and **training or certifications**. None of that is optional if you want professional execution.

### Hidden costs

Then add what doesn't show up on the org chart: **recruiting and onboarding** (3–6 months to full productivity), **management time** (your time or a marketing lead's), **vacations, sick days, turnover**—you cover every gap. And there's the **opportunity cost** of a generalist versus specialists: one person can't do strategy, creative, analytics, and execution at a high level alone.

A single mid-level paid media manager might cost **$80K–$120K** all-in. Add tools (**$2K–$5K/month**) and management overhead, and you're easily at **$10K–$12K/month** for one person.


## What an Agency Actually Costs

An agency gives you a different cost model: predictable monthly spend, no HR on your books, and faster ramp-up.

### Direct costs

You pay a **monthly retainer** (typically $5K–$20K+ for performance work, depending on scope) and **ad spend** (separate—you control this). That's it on the P&L.

### What you get

In return, you get a **team**: strategist, media buyer, analyst, and creative support. You get **tool access and expertise** without buying licenses yourself. You get **no benefits, recruiting, or turnover** on your books—and **faster ramp-up**: days or weeks, not months.

The tradeoff is less control, potential for misalignment, and the need to manage the relationship. But for many brands, *total cost and risk are lower than building in-house from scratch*.


## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Factor | In-House | Agency |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Cost structure** | Salary, benefits, tools, management | Retainer + ad spend |
| **Team** | One or few generalists | Strategist, buyer, analyst, creative |
| **Ramp-up** | 3–6 months | Days to weeks |
| **Turnover risk** | You absorb gaps | Agency absorbs |
| **Variable vs fixed** | Fixed headcount | Variable by scope |


## How to Decide

Use this decision flow to orient yourself before diving into numbers:

  A[Need marketing execution?] --> B{Annual ad spend >$500K?}

  C -->|Yes| D[Lean in-house]

  B -->|No| F{Need speed to market?}
  F -->|Yes| G[Lean agency]
  F -->|No| H[Compare total cost of each]

## When In-House Makes Sense

In-house makes sense when you're **spending enough to justify a full-time specialist**—often **$500K+ annual ad spend**—and when you need **deep integration** with product, sales, or operations. It also helps to have **existing marketing leadership** to manage and develop talent, and when you're playing a **long game** and want institutional knowledge to stay in-house.


## When an Agency Makes Sense

An agency makes sense when you're **sub-scale for a full team** but need expert execution, when you want **speed**—launch and iterate without a long hiring process—and when you prefer **variable cost** over fixed headcount. Agencies also bring **cross-client learnings** and best practices you won't get from a single in-house hire.


## The Bottom Line

Don't compare "agency retainer" to "one salary." Compare **total cost of ownership** (in-house) to **total cost of engagement** (agency). Factor in **time to value** (how fast can you get results?) and **risk** (turnover, ramp-up, single points of failure).

The right choice depends on your stage, spend, and capacity to hire and manage. *Be honest about both the numbers and the intangibles.*`;
