export const VALIDATE_PRODUCT_BEFORE_ADS_CONTENT = `## Why Validation Comes First

Spending on ads before validating a product is like buying a billboard for a restaurant that hasn't opened. You might get attention, but you don't know if anyone will show up—or if the offering is ready when they do.

Validation answers: *Does anyone want this, at this price, from us?* Don't bet your ad budget on a guess.


## What to Validate (and How)

Before you scale paid acquisition, validate four things in order. Each builds on the last.


### Step 1: Validate Demand

Before you build or buy inventory, test whether people care. **Pre-sales or waitlists**—collect emails or take deposits. If no one signs up, demand may be weak. **Landing page tests**—describe the product and offer, measure CTR and signup rate. No ad spend needed; use organic or tiny paid tests. **Manual outreach**—DM or email your ideal customers, offer the product or a beta, gauge interest and objections.

If you can't get **20 people** to raise a hand before you invest heavily, ads won't fix that.


### Step 2: Validate Pricing

Price tests don't require a full funnel. Run simple surveys: "Would you pay $X for this?" Offer early-bird pricing and see conversion. A/B test price points on a small audience before scaling.

The goal: find a price that converts and leaves **margin for CAC**. Too low and you can't afford acquisition; too high and volume dies.


### Step 3: Validate Positioning and Messaging

What resonates? Test angles: **problem-focused** vs. **outcome-focused**, **feature-led** vs. **benefit-led**. Use different hooks and headlines in low-budget tests.

Use qualitative feedback (calls, surveys) and quantitative tests (landing pages, small ad tests). *Double down on what converts.*


### Step 4: Validate Unit Economics

Before scaling ads, know your numbers: **COGS** and **gross margin**, **target CAC** based on LTV, **break-even ROAS**.

If your math doesn't work at small scale, it won't work at large scale. Fix the product, price, or economics before spending heavily on acquisition.


## The Validation Checklist at a Glance

| Step | What to Validate | How |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **1. Demand** | Do people want this? | Waitlist, pre-sales, landing page test, manual outreach |
| **2. Pricing** | Will they pay this price? | Surveys, early-bird offers, A/B tests |
| **3. Positioning** | Does the message resonate? | Problem vs. outcome, feature vs. benefit, headline tests |
| **4. Unit economics** | Does the math work? | COGS, margin, CAC, LTV, break-even ROAS |


## The Validation Sequence

flowchart TD
  A[Validate Demand] --> B{20+ raised hand?}
  B -->|No| C[Fix product or audience]
  B -->|Yes| D[Validate Pricing]
  D --> E{Converts + margin for CAC?}
  E -->|No| F[Adjust price]
  E -->|Yes| G[Validate Positioning]
  G --> H[Validate Unit Economics]
  H --> I{Math works?}
  I -->|Yes| J[Scale ad spend]
  I -->|No| K[Fix economics first]

## The Bottom Line

Only then does ad spend make sense. **Validate first. Scale second.** Don't bet your ad budget on a guess—validate demand, pricing, positioning, and unit economics before you spend.`;
