export const TRAFFIC_ATTENTION_BUYERS_CONTENT = `## Three Different Outcomes

**Traffic** is visits. Clicks. Sessions. It's quantity. A million visitors from a meme might be traffic, but it's rarely valuable.

**Attention** is focus. Someone paused, read, watched, or engaged. They're present. They might not buy, but they're in the room.

**Buyers** are people who take the action you care about: purchase, sign up, book a call. They're the outcome that pays the bills.

Most brands optimize for traffic and call it success. They celebrate impressions and clicks while ignoring whether anyone actually moved toward a purchase. *Understanding the distinction is the key to building a quality funnel.*


## Why the Confusion Hurts

When you treat traffic as the goal, you optimize for **cheap clicks** instead of qualified visitors. You judge campaigns by reach and engagement, not by leads or sales. You build funnels that attract the wrong people and filter out the right ones.

A funnel that attracts **10,000 visitors** and converts **0.1%** is worse than one that attracts **1,000** and converts **5%**. Quality of traffic matters more than volume. The brands that win focus on attention and buyers—not vanity metrics.


## Mapping the Funnel

Think of it as stages: someone lands, stays, raises a hand, and then converts. Each stage has different meaning and different metrics.

| Stage | What It Means | Metrics |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Traffic** | Someone lands on your asset; they might bounce in seconds | Sessions, unique visitors |
| **Attention** | They stay, read, watch, or scroll; they're considering | Time on page, scroll depth, video completion |
| **Intent** | They raise a hand: form fill, add to cart, start checkout | Form submissions, cart adds |
| **Buyer** | They complete the action that generates revenue | Purchases, signups |

Don't measure only traffic. *Measure each stage so you know where the funnel breaks.*

## What to Optimize For

Don't optimize for traffic. Optimize for **attention** and **buyers**.

Use creative and copy that speaks to people with real intent. Design landing experiences that qualify visitors and move them toward action. Measure **cost per attention** and **cost per buyer**, not just cost per click.

When you focus on traffic, you get traffic. When you focus on buyers, you get a business.


## The Bottom Line

Traffic, attention, and buyers are not the same. Most brands treat traffic as a goal and wonder why growth stalls. *Optimize for the stages that lead to revenue—attention and buyers—and measure accordingly.*`;
