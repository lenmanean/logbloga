export const META_VS_GOOGLE_ADS_CONTENT = `## Two Different Intent Signals

**Google Ads**—users are searching. They have a problem or desire and are actively looking for a solution. Intent is high and immediate.

**Meta Ads**—users are scrolling. They're browsing, not hunting. You interrupt with relevance. Intent is lower but **reach is huge**.

Both platforms work, but for different goals and customer journeys. Premium brands need both—*at different stages*.


## When Meta Wins

Meta excels when **discovery is the goal**. New audiences who don't know you exist. Broad reach, interest targeting, lookalikes. It also shines for **visual products**—fashion, beauty, home, lifestyle—where creative carries the message. And for **consideration and retargeting**: warm audiences who've visited, engaged, or added to cart. Meta's retargeting is strong. Dynamic ads, catalog sales, abandoned cart—lower-funnel work fits well.

Use Meta for **top-of-funnel awareness** and **mid-funnel consideration**. Creative and audience testing matter more than keywords.


## When Google Wins

Google excels when **intent is high**. Users searching for your category, brand, or problem. Search ads meet demand that's already there. Use it for **performance branding**—capture brand searches so competitors don't. Defend and convert high-intent traffic. **Shopping ads** and PLAs for e-commerce, when users are comparing options. And for **consideration keywords**: "Best [product]," "reviews," "[competitor] alternative." You intercept the comparison phase.

Use Google when people are actively looking. *Less discovery, more conversion.*


## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Primary Channel | Secondary |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| New brand, no awareness | Meta | — |
| Established brand, defend search | Google | Meta retargeting |
| Visual / impulse product | Meta | Google Shopping |
| High-intent, considered purchase | Google | Meta retargeting |
| Full-funnel growth | Both | — |


## How to Decide

## For Premium Brands

Premium brands often benefit from: **Meta** for discovery and emotional storytelling, **Google** for capturing high-intent searches and defending brand, and **both** for retargeting and remarketing.

Start where your audience is. Test. Allocate budget based on **CAC** and **LTV** by channel, not assumptions. *Both platforms work—the question is when to lean on which.*


## The Bottom Line

Meta and Google serve different intent. Meta for discovery and consideration; Google for capture and conversion. Use the matrix above to orient yourself, then allocate budget based on data—not channel bias.`;
