# Creative Decision Frameworks - Examples & Structure

## What Are Creative Decision Frameworks?

Creative decision frameworks are **guided exercises and prompts** that help users think through decisions we cannot make for them:
- Choosing their niche
- Defining their brand identity
- Generating business ideas
- Selecting target audiences
- Creating value propositions

**Key Principle:** We don't tell them what to choose - we help them discover it through structured thinking.

## Example 1: Niche Selection Framework (Social Media Package)

### Structure: Multi-Step Decision Process

**Step 1: Brainstorming Phase**
```
List 10 niches you're interested in:
1. _________________________
2. _________________________
3. _________________________
... (continue to 10)

For each niche, rate on a scale of 1-10:
- Passion: How much do you enjoy this? (1-10)
- Expertise: How knowledgeable are you? (1-10)
- Market Demand: How many people need this? (1-10)
- Competition: How saturated is this? (1-10, lower = less competition)
- Monetization Potential: Can you make money? (1-10)

Calculate Total Score: Passion + Expertise + Market Demand + (10 - Competition) + Monetization
```

**Step 2: Validation Phase**
```
For your top 3 niches, answer these questions:

NICHE: _________________________

   - @_________________________

4. What's your unique perspective?
