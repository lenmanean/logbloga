# Simple MVP Framework

## Purpose

This framework helps you build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that validates your idea quickly without over-engineering. Focus on the core value, ship fast, and learn from users.

## What is an MVP?

An MVP is the **smallest version of your product** that delivers value to early users and helps you learn what they really want.

**Key Principles**:
- Build only what's necessary
- Ship in 2-4 weeks (Level 1)
- Learn from real users
- Iterate based on feedback

## Step 1: Define Core Value

### What's the ONE thing your product must do?

**Instructions**: If you could only have one feature, what would it be?

**Core Value**:
_________________________________________________

### What's the minimum to deliver this value?

**Must-Have Features** (Maximum 3):
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

**Nice-to-Have Features** (Save for later):
- _________________________________________________
- _________________________________________________
- _________________________________________________

## Step 2: User Flow

### What's the simplest path to value?

**Instructions**: Map out the user journey from landing to "aha!" moment.

**Step 1**: User lands on page
**Step 2**: _________________________________________________
**Step 3**: _________________________________________________
**Step 4**: _________________________________________________
**Step 5**: User gets value / completes action

### What can you remove?

**Instructions**: What steps can you eliminate or automate?

**Remove**:
- _________________________________________________
- _________________________________________________

**Automate with AI**:
- _________________________________________________
- _________________________________________________

## Step 3: Feature Prioritization

### Use the MoSCoW Method

**Must Have** (Critical for MVP):
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

**Should Have** (Important but not critical):
- _________________________________________________
- _________________________________________________

**Could Have** (Nice to have):
- _________________________________________________
- _________________________________________________

**Won't Have** (Not in MVP):
- _________________________________________________
- _________________________________________________

## Step 4: Technical Scope

### What's the simplest tech stack?

**Frontend**:
- Framework: Next.js (recommended)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Components: Built-in or shadcn/ui

**Backend**:
- API Routes: Next.js API routes
- Database: Start without one (add later if needed)
- Authentication: Skip for MVP (add later)

**Payment**:
- Stripe (essential for SaaS)

**Hosting**:
- Vercel (easiest for Next.js)

### What can you fake/manual?

**Instructions**: What can you do manually instead of building?

**Manual Processes** (for MVP):
- Customer support: Email
- Onboarding: Manual setup
- Reports: Generate manually
- Data entry: Manual import

**Automate Later**:

- _________________________________________________

## Step 5: Build Plan

### Week 1: Foundation

**Days 1-2**: Project setup
- [ ] Initialize Next.js
- [ ] Set up GitHub
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Basic landing page

**Days 3-4**: Core feature
- [ ] Build main functionality
- [ ] Basic UI
- [ ] Test locally

**Days 5-7**: Integration
- [ ] Add Stripe
- [ ] Connect payment flow
- [ ] Test end-to-end

### Week 2: Polish

**Days 8-10**: Refinement
- [ ] Fix bugs
- [ ] Improve UI/UX
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Mobile responsive

**Days 11-12**: Testing
- [ ] Test all flows
- [ ] Get feedback from 3-5 people
- [ ] Fix critical issues

**Days 13-14**: Launch prep
- [ ] Final testing
- [ ] Prepare marketing
- [ ] Go live!

## Step 6: Success Metrics

### How will you know it's working?

**Key Metrics** (Choose 2-3):
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

**Example Metrics**:
- Sign-ups per day
- Payment conversions
- User engagement
- Time to value

### What's your success threshold?

**Instructions**: What number means "this is working"?

**Example**: "10 paying customers in first month"

**Your Threshold**:
_________________________________________________

## Step 7: Learning Goals

### What do you need to learn?

**Instructions**: What questions do you need answered?

**Key Questions**:
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

**Example Questions**:
- Do people actually want this?
- What price point works?
- Which features matter most?
- How do people find us?

### How will you gather feedback?

**Methods**:
- [ ] User interviews (5-10 people)
- [ ] Survey after signup
- [ ] Analytics tracking
- [ ] Support emails
- [ ] Social media comments

## Step 8: MVP Checklist

### Before Building

- [ ] Core value is defined
- [ ] Must-have features identified (max 3)
- [ ] User flow mapped
- [ ] Tech stack chosen
- [ ] Build plan created
- [ ] Success metrics defined

### During Building

- [ ] Stay focused (no feature creep!)
- [ ] Test as you build
- [ ] Get feedback early
- [ ] Keep it simple

### Before Launch

- [ ] All must-have features work
- [ ] Payment processing works
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Tested with real users
- [ ] Analytics set up

## Common MVP Mistakes

### ❌ Over-Engineering

**Mistake**: Building features you don't need yet
**Solution**: Stick to must-haves only

### ❌ Perfectionism

**Mistake**: Waiting until it's "perfect"
**Solution**: Ship at 80% quality, improve based on feedback

### ❌ No User Input

**Mistake**: Building in isolation
**Solution**: Get feedback from day 1

### ❌ Complex Tech

**Mistake**: Using advanced tools unnecessarily
**Solution**: Use simplest solution that works

## AI Assistance

### Using ChatGPT

**Prompts**:
- "Help me prioritize features for my MVP: [list features]"
- "What's the simplest way to build [feature]?"
- "What should I cut from my MVP to ship faster?"

### Using Cursor

- Generate MVP code quickly
- Create simple components
- Build basic features fast

## MVP Examples

### Good MVPs

**Dropbox**: Started with a simple video demo
**Airbnb**: Started with air mattresses and breakfast
**Zappos**: Started by taking photos of shoes at stores

**Your MVP**: Focus on core value, nothing more!

## Next Steps
