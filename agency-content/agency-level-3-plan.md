# Established Multi-Service Agency — Implementation Plan

Step-by-step roadmap for scaling to a 5+ person team and reaching $15,000–$50,000+/month. **Most comprehensive** implementation plan in the Agency package: most phases, substeps, examples, and deepest troubleshooting.

## Overview

This implementation plan guides you through scaling from small team agency to established multi-service agency over 12–16 weeks. You'll add GoHighLevel enterprise and enterprise platform stack; Enterprise Operations, Team Scaling, and Enterprise Service Development frameworks; Enterprise Outreach and Partnership Strategies; and scaling revenue so you can manage 10+ clients with a 5+ person team and reach $15,000–$50,000+/month.

**Who this is for:** Agency leads with or building a 5+ person team aiming for $15,000–$50,000+/month—with Level 2 complete (or equivalent), enterprise tools in use or planned, and partnerships or strategic deals in play. AI leverage (enterprise AI platforms, ChatGPT, Claude, AI analytics) supports multi-service delivery and premium offerings.

**Expected outcome:** GoHighLevel enterprise and enterprise platform stack in use; Enterprise Operations Framework, Team Scaling Guide, and Enterprise Service Development completed; Enterprise Outreach Guide and Partnership Strategies in use; Enterprise Templates (ZIP) in use; Scaling & Revenue Strategy and Enterprise Budget Planning in use. Platform costs in the $800–2,000/month range for Level 3.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Level 2 complete or equivalent** (2–5 person team, 5–10 clients, GoHighLevel or Option B stack, Team Management, Service Suite, Client Retention, Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy in use)
- **Enterprise tools and partnerships:** [GoHighLevel Enterprise Setup](gohighlevel-enterprise-setup.md) and [Enterprise Platform Setup](enterprise-platform-setup.md); willingness to invest in enterprise-tier platforms and (optional) partnership or M&A exploration
- **Capacity and revenue:** 5+ person team (or plan to scale to 5+ within 12–16 weeks); revenue trajectory toward $15k–$50k+/month

**Platform setup:** For step-by-step setup, use the Platform Setup Guides in this level: [GoHighLevel Enterprise Setup](gohighlevel-enterprise-setup.md) and [Enterprise Platform Setup](enterprise-platform-setup.md). Level 3 uses a single path (no Option A/B); both guides support enterprise-scale CRM, delivery, and reporting.

## Working with AI Tools

AI can support enterprise proposal drafts, SOW templates, report summaries, partnership outreach, and board-style summaries so you scale delivery and sales without sacrificing quality.

### For Non-Technical Users

**Effective use of AI:**
- **Enterprise proposal drafts:** "We're a [niche] agency with a 5+ person team. Our service lines are [brief]. Write a 3-page enterprise proposal structure with summary, scope by service line, deliverables, team, investment, and terms. Tone: professional, enterprise."
- **SOW templates:** "Document a multi-service SOW template: scope by service line, deliverables, timelines, payment terms, change order process, termination." Edit for your actual terms.
- **Report summaries:** Paste metrics and ask AI for a 2–3 paragraph board-style summary. You approve and send.

**When to do it yourself:** Strategy, hiring, key client and partner relationships, pricing, and final approval. AI drafts; you own the relationship and the decision.

### For All Users

**Use AI for:** Enterprise proposal drafts, SOW templates, report summaries, partnership outreach templates, board-style summaries. Always review and personalize AI output before sending to clients, partners, or board.

**Do yourself:** Strategy, hiring, key relationships, pricing, partnerships, and legal/finance decisions. Keep relationships and key decisions human.
