# Partnership & Strategic Alliances

How to build and run partnerships (partner types, deal structure, referral/revenue share, tracking and governance)—supporting $15,000–$50,000+/month at Level 3.

## Overview

Partnerships (referral, reseller, co-marketing, strategic) can drive enterprise pipeline and revenue without proportional sales cost. This guide covers partner types, deal structure (referral fee vs revenue share), tracking and governance so you know what's working and how to scale. Time investment: 12–16 weeks; expected revenue $15,000–$50,000+/month when you have 10+ clients and partnership-sourced pipeline. Use with [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md) for outreach and positioning.

## Why Partnerships Matter

At Level 3 you're competing for enterprise deals. Partners (consultancies, agencies, platforms, influencers) can refer or co-sell so you get warm leads and shorter cycles. Without a clear partner type, deal structure, and tracking, you either leave money on the table or overcommit to bad-fit partners. This guide turns partnerships into a repeatable channel.

## Step 1: Partner Types (Who to Partner With)

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to define; ongoing to recruit  
**Purpose:** Focus on partner types that fit your service lines and ideal client so referrals are qualified.

### Sub-steps

1. **Referral partners.** They refer clients to you; you pay a referral fee (one-time or % of first contract). Example: consultants who don't do execution; agencies who don't do your service line; coaches who serve the same buyer. Use [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) ideal client to match (e.g. B2B consultants who serve marketing leaders).
2. **Reseller or white-label partners.** They sell your service under their brand; you deliver. Deal: revenue share or wholesale price. Example: larger agency that wants to offer your specialty without hiring. Use when you have capacity and they have pipeline.
3. **Co-marketing partners.** You co-host webinars, events, or content; you share leads or cost. Example: platform (e.g. CRM, marketing tool) that shares your buyer. Use for brand and lead gen; track leads and closes from co-marketing.
4. **Strategic partners.** Deep relationship: joint offering, integration, or M&A exploration. Example: complementary agency (e.g. you do content, they do paid) for joint pitches. Use when you want to expand offer or enter new vertical.
5. **List 10–20 target partners.** Use LinkedIn, referral, or industry events. Prioritize referral partners first (easiest to start); add reseller and co-marketing when you have a one-pager and case studies. Document in CRM (tag "Partner: [Name]" or "Partner type: Referral").

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Partner types defined (referral, reseller, co-marketing, strategic); [ ] 10–20 target partners listed; [ ] Fit with service lines and ideal client clear

## Step 2: Deal Structure (Referral Fee vs Revenue Share)

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to define; document in contract  
**Purpose:** Set clear terms so partners know what they get and you protect margin.

### Sub-steps

1. **Referral fee (one-time).** Pay X% of first contract value (e.g. 10–20%) or a flat fee (e.g. $500–$2,000) when the referred client signs. Define: when you pay (on signed contract, on first payment, or after 90 days to avoid churn). Put in a short partner agreement or email. Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) partnership outline template.
2. **Revenue share (ongoing).** Pay X% of revenue for the life of the client (e.g. 5–15%) or for the first 12 months. Use when the partner has ongoing influence (e.g. reseller, white-label). Define: how you track (CRM tag, report monthly), when you pay (monthly, quarterly). Put in partner agreement.
3. **Co-marketing (cost share or lead share).** Split cost of event or campaign; or split leads 50/50. Define: who owns the lead (first touch wins, or rotate). Document in a short MOU or email.
4. **Strategic (custom).** Joint offering: define revenue split (e.g. 60/40 by who does what). Integration: define who builds, who supports. M&A: NDA and term sheet; get legal involved. Use [Enterprise Operations Issues](agency-level-3-enterprise-operations-issues.md) (partnerships section) for deal disputes.
5. **Margin check.** Ensure referral fee or revenue share leaves you with healthy margin. Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) for target margin; don't give away more than 20–25% of first-year value unless the partner is strategic.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Referral fee or revenue share (or both) defined; [ ] Co-marketing and strategic (if any) terms clear; [ ] Partner agreement or outline in use; [ ] Margin checked

## Step 3: Tracking and Governance

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to set up; ongoing to run  
**Purpose:** Track partner-sourced leads, pipeline, and revenue so you know what's working and how to scale.

### Sub-steps

1. **CRM tagging.** In [GoHighLevel Enterprise](gohighlevel-enterprise-setup.md) or equivalent, tag every lead and deal with partner name (e.g. "Partner: [Name]") and partner type (Referral, Reseller, Co-marketing). Use custom field or tag. When the deal closes, you can report: pipeline by partner, revenue by partner.
2. **Pipeline and revenue report.** Monthly: list partners who referred or sourced leads; count leads, proposals, closed won, revenue. Use for [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) (revenue by channel). Share with Owner or Account director so you double down on top partners.
3. **Partner payouts.** Track referral fee or revenue share due per partner. Pay on time (e.g. within 30 days of close or of month-end). Document in partner agreement. Use [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) for cash flow (payouts are an expense).
4. **Governance (who owns partnerships).** Assign one person (Owner or Partnerships lead) to recruit partners, sign agreements, and track pipeline and payouts. Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) for when to add a dedicated Partnerships role (e.g. when partnership pipeline is 20%+ of revenue).
5. **Review quarterly.** Which partners sent qualified leads? Which sent closed revenue? Increase touchpoints with top partners; reduce or end underperformers. Use [Enterprise Operations Issues](agency-level-3-enterprise-operations-issues.md) for partner disputes or deal structure issues.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] CRM tagging for partner-sourced leads and deals; [ ] Pipeline and revenue by partner reported monthly; [ ] Payouts tracked and paid on time; [ ] Owner or Partnerships lead assigned; [ ] Quarterly review in place
