# Zite Setup Guide

Step-by-step setup for Zite so you can manage client deliverables, approvals, and feedback in one place—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month with a 2–5 person team (Option B).

## Overview

**Option B (Best-of-Breed).** Zite gives you a platform for client-facing deliverables, review, and approval so your team can send work for feedback and sign-off without email chaos. For Level 2 small team agency ($5,000–$15,000/month, 6–8 weeks, $300–800 platform costs), Option B means using [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md) for CRM and marketing, [ClickUp paid](clickup-paid-setup.md) for tasks and delivery, and Zite for client deliverables and approvals. This guide covers account setup, projects and deliverables, client access and review, approval workflows, and integration with your delivery process.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option B (Best-of-Breed)**. Use it together with [HubSpot Paid Setup](hubspot-paid-setup.md) and [ClickUp Paid Setup](clickup-paid-setup.md) for the full Option B stack. If you chose **Option A (GoHighLevel)**, use the [GoHighLevel Setup Guide](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) instead; you may still use Zite for client review if your all-in-one platform doesn’t cover approvals.

## Prerequisites

- Email address and payment method for Zite plan (team or agency tier)
- [Level 1 complete or equivalent](agency-level-1-plan.md) (niche, service packages, first clients)
- [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) in progress (who sends deliverables, who manages client feedback)
- Optional: [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) for deliverable types and review steps

**Time:** About 1–1.5 hours total (account and team ~20 min; projects and deliverables ~35 min; approval workflow ~20 min).

## Step 1: Account and Team Setup

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a Zite account and add team members so the right people can upload deliverables and manage client review.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [zite.com](https://www.zite.com) (or the current Zite product URL) and sign up with your email. Choose a **team** or **agency** plan that supports 2–5 users and multiple projects/clients.
2. **Complete billing** and verify your account is active. Ensure you have at least 2 user seats if you're adding team members.
3. **Invite team members:** Add team members by email. Assign roles (e.g. Admin, Member) per your [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md). Typically, delivery leads and account managers need access; restrict billing/settings to owner or admin.
4. **Verify:** Each invited user can log in and see the dashboard. Confirm they can create or access projects (once created).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Zite account created; [ ] Plan supports 2+ users and multiple projects; [ ] Team members invited and can access dashboard

## Step 2: Projects and Deliverables

**Time estimate:** 25–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a project structure (e.g. one project per client or per engagement) and upload your first deliverable so you can send it for client review.

### Sub-steps

1. In Zite, go to **Projects** (or **Workspace**). Create a new **project** (e.g. "Client A – Website copy" or "Client B – Q1 campaign"). Name it so the team and client can identify it easily.
2. **Project settings:** Set the project type or visibility (e.g. client-facing). Add a short description or link to the engagement (optional). Add **client contacts** (email addresses) who will receive deliverables and provide feedback. You can add multiple reviewers if the client has several stakeholders.
3. **Upload a deliverable:** Upload a file (e.g. PDF, DOCX, image, or link) that represents a draft or final deliverable. Use a naming convention (e.g. "ClientA_HomepageCopy_v1.pdf") so versioning is clear. Add a short note or instructions for the client (e.g. "Please review by [date]; focus on Section 2").
4. **Deliverable types:** Align with your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP). Common types: strategy doc, creative draft, report, final deliverable. Create a habit of one project per client (or per campaign) and one deliverable per submission round.
5. **Verify:** The deliverable appears in the project. Client contacts are associated with the project. You're ready to send for review (next step).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one project created with a clear name; [ ] Client contact(s) added; [ ] One deliverable uploaded with a note; [ ] Ready to send for review

## Step 3: Client Access and Review

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Send the deliverable to the client and configure how they view and comment so feedback is collected in one place.

### Sub-steps

1. In the project, use **Send for review** (or equivalent). Zite will send an email to the client contact(s) with a link to view the deliverable. Optionally set a **due date** for feedback (e.g. 5 business days).
2. **Client view:** Ensure the client can view the file (or link) in the browser without downloading if that’s your preference. They should see a clear way to **comment** (e.g. inline comments, or a feedback form). Test by opening the client link in an incognito window or from another email.
3. **Notifications:** Configure notifications so your team is notified when the client submits feedback or marks the deliverable approved. This keeps handoffs tight (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md)).
4. **Versioning (optional):** If you upload a new version (e.g. v2 after feedback), ensure the client sees the latest version and (if applicable) previous comments are preserved or summarized. Document your versioning approach in your [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP).
5. **Test:** Send a test review to your own email (as client). Open the link, add a comment, and (if available) approve. Confirm your team receives the notification.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Deliverable sent for review; [ ] Client link works and comments are possible; [ ] Team notified on client feedback or approval; [ ] Test review completed

## Step 4: Approval Workflow and Sign-Off

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Define how clients approve deliverables (e.g. approve/reject, or comment-only) and how you close the loop in your delivery process.

### Sub-steps

1. In Zite, open **Settings** or **Workflow** for the project (or account). Configure **approval** behavior: e.g. client must click "Approve" or "Sign off" to mark the deliverable complete; or feedback-only with no formal approval step. Choose what fits your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and client contracts.
2. **Sign-off record:** If the client approves, ensure you have a record (e.g. timestamp, approver name) for your files. Use this for scope compliance and [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) (e.g. "Approved on [date]" in status reports).
3. **Rejection or revision:** If the client requests changes, document how you handle it: e.g. new version uploaded to the same project, new round of review, and optional revision counter. Align with your SOW or contract (see [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) for scope and revision limits).
4. **Close the loop with ClickUp (optional):** When a deliverable is approved, create a task in [ClickUp](clickup-paid-setup.md) (e.g. "Client A – Deliverable 1 approved") or mark a phase complete. This keeps delivery and client review in sync.
5. **Verify:** Run one full cycle: send → client comments → (optional) revise → client approves. Confirm your team sees the approval and knows the next step (e.g. invoice, handoff, or archive).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Approval or feedback workflow configured; [ ] Sign-off record available; [ ] Revision process clear; [ ] Optional sync with ClickUp or internal task; [ ] Full cycle tested
