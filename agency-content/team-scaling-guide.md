# Team Scaling Guide

Guided exercises to define hiring, roles, capacity, and revenue-per-head so you can scale to 5+ and beyond—supporting $15,000–$50,000+/month at Level 3. **Most detailed** framework in the Agency package: longest "How to use," most granular parts, **3+ worked examples**.

## Purpose

Clear team scaling (hiring, roles, capacity, revenue-per-head) prevents overhire or underhire and keeps delivery and margin healthy. For Level 3 established multi-service agency ($15,000–$50,000+/month, 12–16 weeks, $800–2,000 platform costs), defining when to hire, what roles to add, how much capacity each role carries, and what revenue-per-head you need keeps 10+ clients and 5+ people sustainable. Without it, you hire too early (burn cash) or too late (burn out the team).

## How to Use

- **Time:** 90–120 minutes (longest framework in the package)  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 1 of the [Level 3 Implementation Plan](agency-level-3-plan.md) (Enterprise Positioning and Platforms); align with [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md), [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md), [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md), and [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF). Use when planning hiring or contractor adds.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft "agency hiring plan for 5+ person team" or "revenue-per-head by role agency"; then customize for your service lines and margins.

## Part 1: Current Roles and Capacity (Fill-In)

### Who you have and how much they can carry

**Current team (role, approximate cost, capacity):**
- Role 1: _________________________________________________ Cost: $_________/month Capacity: _________________________________________________
- Role 2: _________________________________________________ Cost: $_________/month Capacity: _________________________________________________
- Role 3: _________________________________________________ Cost: $_________/month Capacity: _________________________________________________
- Role 4 (if applicable): _________________________________________________ Cost: $_________/month Capacity: _________________________________________________
- Role 5 (if applicable): _________________________________________________ Cost: $_________/month Capacity: _________________________________________________

**Capacity = clients per person, or hours per week per service line (define):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Owner $5,000 (strategy, sales, key clients). Delivery director $4,000 (4–5 clients, oversees Delivery leads). Delivery lead 1 $3,000 (3–4 clients). Delivery lead 2 $3,000 (3–4 clients). Account manager $2,500 (8–10 client relationships). Capacity: 10–12 clients total with 5 people; revenue target $20k–$25k so revenue-per-head ~$4k–$5k."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Current roles and cost listed; [ ] Capacity per role defined; [ ] Revenue target and revenue-per-head calculated

## Part 2: When to Scale (Triggers)

### Revenue and capacity triggers for adding a role

**Revenue trigger (e.g. when revenue hits $X/month, add Y role):**
_________________________________________________

**Capacity trigger (e.g. when Delivery lead hits 4 clients or 80% utilization, add Delivery lead or Specialist):**
_________________________________________________

**Pipeline trigger (e.g. when pipeline has $X in proposals or committed starts, add before delivery date):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Revenue trigger: When we hit $18k/month sustained for 2 months, add Account manager or Specialist. Capacity trigger: When a Delivery lead hits 4 clients, add another Delivery lead or Specialist. Pipeline trigger: When we have 2 signed starts in next 30 days and no capacity, add before start date."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Revenue and capacity triggers set; [ ] Pipeline trigger (if applicable) set; [ ] Align with [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md)

## Part 3: Hiring Criteria and Role Definition (Fill-In)

### What each new role looks like (so you hire the right person)

**Next role to add (e.g. Delivery lead, Specialist, Account manager):**
_________________________________________________

**Responsibilities (3–5 bullets):**
_________________________________________________

**Capacity (clients or hours this role will carry):**
_________________________________________________

**Cost range (salary or contractor):**
_________________________________________________

**Revenue this role must support (revenue-per-head target):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Next role: Delivery lead. Responsibilities: own 3–4 client delivery; assign tasks to Specialist; run kickoff and status; escalate to Delivery director. Capacity: 3–4 clients. Cost: $3k–$3.5k/month. Revenue support: $12k–$14k (3–4 clients at $3k–$4k average) so margin stays healthy."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Next role and responsibilities clear; [ ] Capacity and cost defined; [ ] Revenue-per-head target set; [ ] Align with [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) roles

## Part 4: Contractor vs Full-Time (Fill-In)

### When to use contractors vs full-time hires

**Use contractor when:**
_________________________________________________

**Use full-time when:**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Contractor: for a specific service line we're testing (e.g. paid media); for overflow or peak; for specialist skills we don't need 40 hrs/week. Full-time: for core delivery (Delivery lead, Account manager); when we need 30+ hrs/week consistently; when we need them in our tools and culture daily."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Contractor vs full-time criteria set; [ ] Align with [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) cash flow

## Worked Example 1: 5-Person Agency (Owner, Delivery Director, 2 Delivery Leads, Account Manager)

**Current:** Owner $5k, Delivery director $4k, 2 Delivery leads $3k each, Account manager $2.5k = $17.5k team cost. Capacity: 10–12 clients. Revenue target $22k–$28k. Revenue-per-head ~$4.4k–$5.6k.

**Triggers:** Add Specialist when a Delivery lead hits 4 clients or when revenue hits $25k for 2 months. Add second Account manager when Account manager hits 10 clients.

**Next role:** Specialist (content or paid). Responsibilities: execute per Delivery lead brief; 2–3 clients' execution. Cost $2k–$2.5k. Revenue support $6k–$9k (2–3 clients at $3k). Contractor until we have 3+ clients needing that skill set full-time.

## Worked Example 2: 7-Person Agency (Multi-Service)

**Current:** Owner $6k, Delivery director $4.5k, Content lead $3.5k, Paid lead $3.5k, Creative lead $3k, 2 Account managers $2.5k each = $25k. Capacity: 15–18 clients across 3 service lines. Revenue target $35k–$45k. Revenue-per-head ~$5k–$6.4k.

**Triggers:** Add Delivery lead (in any line) when that line's lead hits 5 clients. Add Account manager when Account managers hit 10 clients each. Add Owner/strategist when enterprise deals need more Owner time.

**Next role:** Account manager 3. Responsibilities: 8–10 client relationships; renewal and upsell. Cost $2.5k. Revenue support: retain and grow $20k–$25k in accounts. Full-time because client relationships need consistency.

---

## Worked Example 3: 8-Person Agency (Enterprise + Partnerships)

**Current:** Owner $7k, Account director $5k, Delivery director $4.5k, 2 Delivery leads $3.5k each, Account manager $2.5k, Specialist $2k, Partnerships lead $3k = $31.5k. Capacity: 12–15 direct clients + partnership-sourced pipeline. Revenue target $45k–$55k. Revenue-per-head ~$5.6k–$6.9k.

**Triggers:** Add Delivery lead when Delivery leads hit 4 clients each. Add Specialist when Specialists are at 3 clients each. Add Account manager when Account manager hits 12 clients. Partnerships lead: add when partnership pipeline is 20%+ of revenue and needs dedicated owner.

**Next role:** Delivery lead 3 (or Specialist 2). Responsibilities: 3–4 clients; same as existing Delivery lead. Cost $3.5k (or $2k contractor). Revenue support $12k–$14k. Full-time if pipeline is committed; contractor if overflow.
