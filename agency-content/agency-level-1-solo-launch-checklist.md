# Solo Launch Checklist

A checklist to get your solo agency launch-ready so you can reach $2,000–$5,000/month.

## Purpose

Before you scale outreach, you need positioning live, packages documented, and onboarding ready. This checklist ensures you've done the essentials so first clients get a professional experience. For Level 1 ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), completing this means you're ready to execute the [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) without scrambling.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes to complete all items  
- **When:** Use in Phase 3 of the [Implementation Plan](agency-level-1-plan.md) (First agency clients and launch); after frameworks and platform setup.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft website or LinkedIn copy from your [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) and [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md); then personalize.

Complete each substep in order. Cross-ref all L1 frameworks and the [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md).

## Step 1: Positioning and Messaging Live (Website / LinkedIn)

**Time estimate:** 20–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Your niche and offer are visible somewhere so prospects can understand who you are and what you do.

### Sub-steps

- [ ] **Niche statement live:** Your one-sentence niche (from [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) Part 3) appears on your website homepage, LinkedIn headline, or both. Example: "We help B2B SaaS grow organic traffic and leads with content strategy and SEO."
- [ ] **One differentiator visible:** Your differentiator (from Agency Niche Framework Part 3) is stated (e.g. "B2B-only, 2-week sprints" or "Real estate content that sounds like you").
- [ ] **Clear next step:** A CTA is visible: "Book a call," "Get in touch," or "DM me." Link to your calendar (Systeme.io, Calendly, or HubSpot) or contact form.
- [ ] **Proof (if you have it):** One case study, result, or testimonial is linked or mentioned. If you don't have proof yet, write "Case studies coming soon" or skip; add after first client.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Niche statement and differentiator live; [ ] CTA and link work; [ ] You'd be comfortable sending a prospect to this page or profile

## Step 2: Packages and Pricing Documented

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** You have a one-pager or page that shows your packages and price so you can send it in proposals or link from LinkedIn.

### Sub-steps

- [ ] **Packages listed:** Your 2–3 packages (from [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) Part 2) are written down with scope (deliverables) and price. Use the same wording you'll use in proposals.
- [ ] **Where it lives:** The package doc lives in a PDF, Notion page, or website page. You can attach it to a proposal or send the link.
- [ ] **Add-ons and boundaries (optional):** If you want to avoid scope creep, note add-ons and "out of scope" (from Service Package Framework Part 3) in the doc or in your proposal template.
- [ ] **Pricing floor:** You know your minimum (from [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md)) and you won't go below it without a clear reason (e.g. pilot for case study).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Package doc exists and is accurate; [ ] You can send it or link to it; [ ] Pricing floor is clear to you

## Step 3: First 5–10 Outreach Actions

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes (first batch); then 15–20 min/day  
**Purpose:** Pipeline starts with action. Send 5–10 messages, emails, or referral asks so you have leads in motion.

### Sub-steps

- [ ] **List 5–10 people** from your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) list (see [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) Step 1). Mix warm and cold if you have warm.
- [ ] **Send 5–10 outreach messages** (LinkedIn, email, or referral ask). Use the outreach examples in the First Agency Clients Guide. Track: name, company, date sent, reply/call/proposal.
- [ ] **Follow up once** if no reply in 5–7 days. One short message: "Wanted to make sure you saw this—happy to jump on a call if you have questions."
- [ ] **Book at least one call** (or get one reply). If you don't get a call from the first 10, send 10 more and refine your message (shorter, clearer ask, or different segment).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] 5–10 outreach actions sent; [ ] You're tracking in a list or sheet; [ ] At least one call booked or reply received (or next 10 sent)

## Step 4: Onboarding Process Ready (Client Onboarding Template)

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** When a client says yes, you know exactly what to send and in what order so you look professional and don't forget steps.

### Sub-steps

- [ ] **Client Onboarding Template (ZIP) reviewed:** You've opened or read the [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) from the Templates section (or the [client-onboarding-template-spec.md](client-onboarding-template-spec.md) if the ZIP isn't built yet). You know what's in it: welcome email, discovery questionnaire, kickoff agenda, checklist.
- [ ] **Sequence clear:** You've written down the order: (1) Send welcome email, (2) Send contract, (3) On signature send first invoice, (4) Send discovery form, (5) Schedule kickoff when discovery is back, (6) Hold kickoff and confirm first deliverables. Adjust if your tools differ (e.g. Systeme.io vs Hello Bonsai).
- [ ] **Templates ready:** Your welcome email draft and discovery form (or link) are ready so you can send within 24 hours of close. Contract and invoice are in [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) or [Systeme.io](systeme-io-setup-guide.md).
- [ ] **Checklist for you:** You have a personal checklist (from the ZIP or your own) so you don't skip a step (contract signed, invoice sent, discovery done, kickoff held, first tasks in ClickUp or Systeme.io).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Onboarding sequence documented; [ ] Welcome and discovery ready; [ ] You can onboard a client within 24–48 hours of "yes"

## Step 5: Operations and Troubleshooting Bookmarked

**Time estimate:** 5–10 minutes  
**Purpose:** When something goes wrong (scope creep, late payment, pipeline dry), you know where to look.

### Sub-steps

- [ ] **Solo Operations Issues guide bookmarked:** [Solo Operations Issues](agency-level-1-solo-operations-issues.md) is saved or bookmarked. You've read the section headers (Niche and positioning; Service scope and pricing; First clients and pipeline; Platform and delivery; Billing and contracts) so you know where to go when an issue comes up.
- [ ] **Solo Revenue Strategy and Solo Budget Worksheet in use:** You've started using the [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) and [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) so revenue and costs are tracked. Update at least monthly.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Solo Operations Issues bookmarked; [ ] Revenue and budget tracking started
