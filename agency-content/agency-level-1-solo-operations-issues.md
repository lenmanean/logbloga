# Solo Agency Operations Issues

Common issues and solutions for solo agency operations ($2,000–$5,000/month). For each issue: causes, step-by-step resolution, prevention, and when to escalate.

---

## Niche and Positioning

### Issue 1: Niche is too broad or undefined

**Causes:** You say "we do marketing" or "we help businesses grow" so you sound like everyone else. No clear niche statement or differentiator. Prospects can't tell why they should choose you.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Complete or revisit the [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md). Part 1: expertise and market. Part 2: demand and competition. Part 3: niche statement and differentiator. Part 4: validation (who would pay, proof).
2. Write one sentence: "We help [ideal client] achieve [outcome] through [what you do]. We're different because [differentiator]." Use it on your website, LinkedIn, and in every proposal.
3. Remove or avoid generic language ("we do digital marketing," "we help businesses"). Replace with your niche and differentiator. Test with 2–3 people: "What do I do? Who do I serve?"

**Prevention:** Revisit the Agency Niche Framework only when you're deliberately pivoting. Before every outreach or proposal, ask: "Does this match my niche statement?" If not, don't chase the lead or reframe the offer.

**When to escalate:** If you've defined a niche and still get no traction after 20–30 quality outreach actions: consider whether demand is real (referrals, RFPs, LinkedIn engagement) or whether you need a coach or mentor in that niche.

---

### Issue 2: Positioning doesn't match your offer

**Causes:** Your website or LinkedIn says one thing (e.g. "B2B content") but your packages or outreach say another (e.g. "we do social and ads"). Prospects are confused and don't book calls.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Align [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) Part 3 (niche statement, differentiator) with your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) (core offer, packages). They must match. If you've pivoted packages, update your niche statement and all public copy.
2. Audit website and LinkedIn: headline, about, services. Remove anything that doesn't match your current offer. Add one proof point (case study, result, testimonial) that supports the niche.
3. Use the same wording in outreach and proposals. "We help [X] with [Y]" should be identical on website, LinkedIn, and proposal summary.

**Prevention:** When you add a new service or change packages, update niche statement and all client-facing copy in one pass. Keep one "master" doc (e.g. positioning + packages) and pull from it for website, LinkedIn, and proposals.

**When to escalate:** If you've aligned everything and still get no replies: the issue may be offer-market fit, pricing, or channel (e.g. wrong platform for your buyer). Consider a positioning or messaging audit with a mentor or consultant.

---

### Issue 3: No proof points and prospects don't trust you

**Causes:** You're new and have no case studies or testimonials. Prospects say "we need to see proof" or ghost after the proposal.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Offer one pilot or discounted engagement (e.g. 3 months at 20% off) in exchange for a case study and testimonial. Document results (traffic, leads, engagement) and get a short quote and permission to use.
2. Use past work: if you have freelance or in-house results, reframe them as "project highlights" (anonymized if needed) with outcome (e.g. "30% traffic increase in 6 months"). Add "Case study available on request" if you can't publish.
3. Add social proof to your proposal: one case study or testimonial, even if it's the only one. Lead with outcome (number or quote) and keep the rest short.
4. Ask for referrals from people who know your work (past boss, colleague, client). Use a one-liner they can forward: " [Name] helps [niche] with [offer]. Worth a intro if you know someone looking."

**Prevention:** After every successful project, ask for a testimonial and 1–2 sentences on results. Build a "proof" folder (screenshots, quotes, metrics) so you're never starting from zero for the next proposal.

**When to escalate:** If you've done a pilot and still can't close the next 2–3 leads: consider whether the niche or price is the barrier. You may need to lower price temporarily, narrow niche further, or get a referral-only pipeline until you have 2–3 case studies.

---

### Issue 4: You're competing on price and can't command premium

**Causes:** You're positioning as "affordable" or "cheap" or you're undercutting to win. Clients treat you as a commodity and push back on scope or payment.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Set a minimum price (from [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md)) and don't go below it unless you have a written pilot agreement (e.g. discount for case study, 3-month only). Say "My minimum for this scope is $X" and stick to it.
2. Reframe your positioning: lead with outcome and proof, not price. "We help B2B SaaS grow organic traffic—here's a case study" instead of "We're affordable."
3. Add value to the offer (e.g. strategy call, report, onboarding doc) so the price is justified. Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) Part 4 (positioning vs competitors) to articulate why you're worth more.
4. If a prospect says "too expensive," ask: "What would need to be true for this to be a yes?" Sometimes it's payment terms (e.g. monthly vs upfront), not the number. Don't drop price without getting something (testimonial, case study, longer commitment).

**Prevention:** Never lead with "we're affordable" or "we're the cheapest." Lead with niche, outcome, and proof. Review [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) monthly so your pricing floor and package mix stay clear.

**When to escalate:** If you've raised prices and positioned on value and still lose every deal on price: you may be targeting the wrong segment (e.g. too small or too price-sensitive). Consider narrowing to clients who have budget (e.g. larger company size, funded startup).

---

### Issue 5: You're pivoting niche and existing messaging is wrong

**Causes:** You changed who you serve or what you offer but your website, LinkedIn, and proposals still say the old thing. Leads are wrong-fit or confused.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Decide the new niche and offer. Complete the [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) and [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) for the new direction. Get clear on one sentence and one differentiator.
2. Update all client-facing copy in one go: website, LinkedIn headline and about, proposal template, email signature. Remove or archive old case studies that don't fit; add "Coming soon" or one new proof point if you have it.
3. Tell your network: "I'm now focusing on [new niche]. If you know anyone who [brief description], I'd love an intro." Redirect wrong-fit leads politely: "I've shifted to [X]; for [old thing] I'd recommend [other resource]."
4. Give it 4–6 weeks. Don't flip back and forth; commit to the new niche for at least 20–30 outreach actions before judging.

**Prevention:** Only pivot when you have evidence (e.g. 10+ wrong-fit leads, or a clear opportunity in the new niche). When you pivot, do one full update of positioning and packages; don't run two positions at once.

**When to escalate:** If you've pivoted and still get no traction: validate demand (ask 5–10 people in the new niche if they'd buy, and at what price). If demand is weak, consider a smaller pivot (e.g. sub-niche of current niche) instead of a full change.

---

## Service Scope and Pricing

### Issue 1: Scope creep—client expects more than you sold

**Causes:** Vague contract or proposal; no clear "out of scope" list; you said yes to one-off requests without updating scope or price.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Document what's in scope and what's not (from your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) Part 1 and Part 3). Add a "Scope" or "Deliverables" section to your contract and proposal. List exclusions (e.g. "Paid ads, design, and video are out of scope unless added as an add-on").
2. When the client asks for something new: "That's outside our current scope. We can add it as an add-on for $X or as a one-off project for $Y." Get agreement in writing (email or contract amendment) before doing the work.
3. If you've already been doing extra work for free, schedule a short call: "We've been doing [X] which wasn't in the original scope. Going forward we'd like to add it formally for $Z so we can keep delivering at this level." Be polite and firm.
4. At renewal, revisit scope. If deliverables have grown, adjust price or add an add-on. Use your [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) for when to raise rates.

**Prevention:** Every new client: clear scope in proposal and contract. Use the [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) kickoff to confirm scope. At renewal, compare what you're delivering to what you're charging and adjust.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to pay for added scope or threatens to leave: decide whether to hold the line or make a one-time exception. If it becomes a pattern, consider ending the contract at renewal or adding a formal change-order process.

---

### Issue 2: You're undercharging and can't sustain delivery

**Causes:** You set price too low to "get the first client" or you didn't factor in your time and platform costs. You're working more hours than the retainer justifies.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Calculate your effective hourly rate: take the monthly retainer, divide by hours you're actually spending on the client (delivery + communication + admin). If it's below your minimum (e.g. $50–75/hour for solo), you're undercharging.
2. Use the [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) and [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) to set a pricing floor. Don't take new clients below that floor unless you have a written pilot (e.g. case study in exchange for discount, 3-month only).
3. At renewal, raise price. Option A: "We're raising rates to $X/month starting [date] to reflect our current scope and market." Option B: Add an add-on or reduce scope to match the current price. Document in a short email or contract amendment.
4. For existing undercharging clients: either (a) reduce scope to match price (fewer deliverables, same quality) or (b) propose a raise at renewal. Don't resent the client; fix the structure.

**Prevention:** Before quoting, estimate hours per month for the scope. Multiply by your minimum hourly rate. That's your floor. Use the [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) Part 2 to set package prices above that floor. Review [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) monthly.

**When to escalate:** If you've raised prices and still can't sustain: consider whether the service is profitable at any price (e.g. too labor-intensive). You may need to change the offer (e.g. fewer deliverables, more templates, or different service mix).

---

### Issue 3: Client disputes deliverables or quality

**Causes:** Unclear acceptance criteria; no review process; client expected something different from what was in scope.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Reopen the contract and proposal. What was explicitly in scope? What was not? If the client is asking for something in scope but you disagree on quality, define "done" (e.g. "Draft 1 = outline + first draft; Final = 2 rounds of revision").
2. Propose a short-term fix: deliver the missing piece or one round of revision to get to "done" as you now define it. Document in email: "Per our agreement, we're delivering [X]. We'll consider this complete unless you have feedback within [Y] days."
3. For future: add acceptance criteria to your proposal or contract (e.g. "Delivery = draft delivered; client has 5 business days to request revisions; max 2 revision rounds"). Use the [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) kickoff to confirm what "done" looks like.
4. If the client still disputes after you've delivered per scope: offer one more revision round or a short call to align. If they refuse to accept and won't pay: see "When to escalate" (legal or mediation).

**Prevention:** Define "done" and revision limits in every proposal and contract. Confirm at kickoff. Send a short summary after each deliverable: "Here’s [X]. Per our scope, this completes [deliverable]. Let me know if you’d like revisions within [Y] days."

**When to escalate:** If the client won't pay despite delivery per scope, or they're abusive: pause delivery, send a formal demand for payment (email or letter), and consider legal advice or small-claims court if the amount justifies it.

---

### Issue 4: You're overpromising to close the deal

**Causes:** You said "yes" to extra deliverables or a faster timeline to win the deal. Now you can't deliver without burning out or missing other clients.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. List what you promised vs what's in your standard scope ([Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md)). Identify the gap (extra deliverables, faster turnaround, or lower price).
2. Option A: Deliver the overpromise once, but document that going forward you'll stick to standard scope and timeline. After delivery, send a short note: "We delivered [X] this time. For future months, our standard scope is [Y] and timeline is [Z]."
3. Option B: Renegotiate. "I overcommitted on [X]. We can either (a) extend the timeline to [date], (b) add a one-time fee for the extra work, or (c) reduce scope to what we can deliver on time." Get agreement in writing.
4. Don't overpromise again. Use a proposal template that only includes your standard packages and timelines. If the prospect asks for more, quote it as an add-on or separate project.

**Prevention:** Never say "yes" to scope or timeline in a call without checking your capacity and package. Say "Let me confirm scope and timeline and send a proposal." Then send a proposal that matches what you can deliver. Use the [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) proposal structure.

**When to escalate:** If you've renegotiated and the client won't budge and you're burning out: consider whether to complete the contract and not renew, or (if contract allows) terminate with notice. Protect your capacity for other clients and your health.

---

### Issue 5: Package doesn't match what the market will pay

**Causes:** Your packages are too cheap (you leave money on the table) or too expensive (no one buys). You haven't tested price or positioning.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Research: What do similar agencies or freelancers charge for your scope? Use the [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) Part 2 (demand and competition) and [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) Part 4 (positioning vs competitors). Adjust your price band (e.g. mid-market, premium).
2. Test: Send 5–10 proposals at your current price. If everyone says "too expensive," consider one of: (a) add more value (strategy call, report, onboarding) and keep price; (b) lower price for a pilot and raise at renewal; (c) target a different segment (larger budget). If everyone says "great price" and you're closing fast, consider raising.
3. Use the [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) revenue model (X clients × $Y = target). If you need $3k/month and your floor is $1.2k, you need 2–3 clients. If you can't close at $1.2k, either improve proof and positioning or lower the floor temporarily and add proof (case study) so you can raise later.
4. Document your pricing logic (why this price, what's included, what's add-on) so you can explain it confidently in proposals and calls.

**Prevention:** Review pricing quarterly. After every 5–10 proposals, note: how many replied, how many said price was an issue, how many closed. Use that to adjust package or positioning.

**When to escalate:** If you've tested price and positioning and still can't close: the issue may be niche demand, proof, or channel. Consider a mentor or consultant to review your offer and pipeline.

## First Clients and Pipeline

### Issue 1: No replies to outreach

**Causes:** Message too long or too generic; wrong channel for your buyer; wrong segment (e.g. too senior or too small); no clear ask; subject line or first line doesn't grab attention.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Shorten the message. First touch: 2–3 sentences. Who you are (one line), what you do (one line), one ask ("Worth a 15-min call?"). No full pitch in the first message.
2. Personalize: use their name, company, and one specific detail (e.g. "I saw [Company] is [recent news or post]"). Generic messages get ignored.
3. Check channel: if your ideal client is on LinkedIn, use LinkedIn. If they're not on social, use email or referral. Ask 2–3 people in your target segment where they get introduced to vendors.
4. A/B test: send 5 messages with one subject/first line and 5 with another. See which gets more opens or replies. Double down on what works.
5. Volume: send 10–20 quality messages per week. Track: sent, opened, replied, call booked. If you're sending 5 and getting zero, send 15–20 before concluding the message is wrong.

**Prevention:** Use the [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) outreach examples. Keep a "best performing" message and reuse its structure. Review your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) so you're targeting the right title and company size.

**When to escalate:** If you've sent 30+ personalized messages and gotten zero replies: consider (a) wrong segment, (b) wrong channel, (c) message still too long or unclear. Get feedback from 2–3 people in your niche: "Would you reply to this?"

---

### Issue 2: Calls booked but no proposals sent or no closes

**Causes:** You're not asking for the next step on the call; you're not sending the proposal fast enough; proposal is unclear or too long; you're not following up.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. End every call with a clear next step: "I'll send a proposal by [date]. When can you decide?" Get a date. If they say "we need to think," ask: "What would help you decide? More info, a reference, or a call with my existing client?"
2. Send the proposal within 24 hours. Use the [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) structure: summary, scope, investment, next step. One to two pages max. Attach or link; don't make them hunt.
3. Follow up: if no reply in 3–5 days, one short follow-up. "Wanted to make sure you saw the proposal—happy to jump on a call if you have questions." If no reply after 2 follow-ups, move on. Don't chase forever.
4. On the call, ask: "What would need to be true for you to say yes?" Address objections (price, proof, timeline) in the proposal or in a short addendum. If they need a reference or case study, send it the same day.

**Prevention:** Use a proposal template so you're not rebuilding every time. Always get a "decision by" date on the call. Block 30 min after every call to send the proposal so it's same-day or next-day.

**When to escalate:** If you're booking calls but never closing: track why (price, proof, timing, competitor). If it's always price, see "Service scope and pricing" (undercharging / overpromising). If it's proof, see "Niche and positioning" (no proof points).

---

### Issue 3: Pipeline is dry and you don't know where the next client will come from

**Causes:** You stopped outreach after landing 1–2 clients; you're not tracking pipeline; you're relying on one channel (e.g. only LinkedIn) and it went quiet.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Restart outreach. Aim for 5–10 new outreach actions per week even when you have clients. Use the [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) Step 1 to list 10–20 leads and Step 3 to send messages. Track in a simple list or sheet (name, company, date sent, reply/call/proposal).
2. Diversify: if LinkedIn isn't working, try referrals. Ask every happy client: "Do you know one person who might be a fit for what we do?" Offer to make it easy (one-liner they can forward). Add email or warm network if you've only been doing cold LinkedIn.
3. Revisit your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md). Are you targeting the right people? If you've been going after CMOs and they don't reply, try Marketing Managers or Founders. Test a different segment.
4. Set a pipeline goal: e.g. "2 proposals out per week" or "1 new call per week." Block time for outreach so it doesn't get pushed by delivery.

**Prevention:** Treat outreach as a weekly habit, not a one-time push. Use the [Solo Launch Checklist](agency-level-1-solo-launch-checklist.md) Step 3 (first 5–10 outreach actions) and repeat. Review pipeline weekly: how many in each stage (lead, call, proposal, close)?

**When to escalate:** If you've diversified and kept volume for 4–6 weeks and pipeline is still dry: consider whether demand is real (are others in your niche getting clients? where?). You may need to niche down further or improve proof and positioning before pipeline fills.

---

### Issue 4: You're closing but clients are wrong-fit (scope creep, payment issues, misery)

**Causes:** You're not filtering by [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md); you're saying yes to anyone who will pay; you didn't clarify scope or payment terms in the proposal.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Revisit your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) Part 4 (client avatar). Write down: "I will not take clients who [X]." Examples: "I will not take clients who need 24-hour turnaround" or "I will not take clients who won't sign a contract or pay upfront."
2. Add a qualification step: on the first call, ask 2–3 questions that screen for fit (e.g. "What's your timeline for making a decision?" "What's your budget range for this?"). If they're wrong-fit, say politely: "It sounds like we might not be the best fit because [X]. I'd recommend [other resource]."
3. For existing wrong-fit clients: deliver what you contracted, but don't renew. At renewal, say: "We're not going to renew; we're focusing on [niche/type]. I'm happy to help with a transition." Document lessons (what made them wrong-fit) and add to your "I will not take" list.
4. In proposals, be explicit: payment terms (e.g. 50% upfront, net 15), revision limits, out-of-scope. Wrong-fit clients often push on these; clear terms help you say no.

**Prevention:** Qualify on the first call. Use the [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) and [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) to say no to bad-fit leads. It's better to have 2 great clients than 3 miserable ones.

**When to escalate:** If a wrong-fit client is abusive or refuses to pay: see "Billing and contracts" (late or disputed payment). If they're just a bad fit but paying, complete the contract and don't renew.

---

### Issue 5: Referrals aren't coming and you're stuck on cold outreach

**Causes:** You're not asking for referrals; you're not making it easy (no one-liner); clients don't know who to refer; you're not staying in touch with past clients or network.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Ask every happy client: "Do you know one person who might be a fit for what we do? I'm looking for [brief description from Target Client Framework]." Send them a one-liner they can forward: " [Name] helps [niche] with [offer]. Worth an intro if you know someone looking."
2. Stay in touch: send a short check-in every 2–3 months (e.g. "Hope things are going well. Here's one tip that might help [relevant to their goal]."). When you have a case study or win, share it. They're more likely to refer when they remember you and have a reason to reach out.
3. Give referrals yourself: introduce two people in your network who should know each other. They'll remember you and may refer back. Build the habit of "who do I know who could help this person?"
4. If you don't have clients yet: ask past colleagues, bosses, or mentors. "I'm now offering [X] to [target client]. Do you know anyone who might be a fit? I can send you a one-liner to forward."

**Prevention:** Add "Ask for referral" to your [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) or post-delivery checklist. After every successful project, ask. Keep a one-liner ready to send.

**When to escalate:** If you've asked 5–10 people and no referrals: either (a) your one-liner isn't clear, (b) your network doesn't overlap with your target client, or (c) you need to deliver more value before people refer. Improve the one-liner and try a different segment of your network.

---

## Platform and Delivery (Option A vs B)

### Issue 1: You're overwhelmed by tools (Option B: too many logins)

**Causes:** Option B uses HubSpot, ClickUp, and Hello Bonsai (or similar). You're switching between 3+ tools and losing track of tasks, deals, or contracts.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Document one workflow: where do you add a lead? (HubSpot.) Where do you add tasks for delivery? (ClickUp.) Where do you send contract and invoice? (Hello Bonsai.) Write it in a one-pager and stick to it.
2. Set a weekly rhythm: e.g. Monday morning check HubSpot (deals, follow-ups), Monday afternoon check ClickUp (this week's tasks). Contract and invoice only when you close or on renewal. Don't check every tool every day if you don't need to.
3. Use one "source of truth" for each type: HubSpot for pipeline, ClickUp for delivery, Hello Bonsai for money. Don't duplicate (e.g. don't keep a separate spreadsheet for deals if HubSpot is your CRM).
4. If you're still overwhelmed: consider switching to Option A (Systeme.io) so you have one login for CRM, pipeline, email, calendar, and contracts. See [Systeme.io Setup Guide](systeme-io-setup-guide.md).

**Prevention:** When you add a new client, do the same steps every time (add to CRM, add to ClickUp, send contract and invoice). Use the [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) checklist so you don't forget a tool.

**When to escalate:** If Option B is still too much after 4–6 weeks: migrate to Option A (Systeme.io) or simplify Option B (e.g. use only HubSpot and Hello Bonsai, and a simple task list instead of ClickUp) until you have capacity for more tools.

---

### Issue 2: Systeme.io (Option A) is missing a feature you need

**Causes:** You chose Option A for simplicity but you need something Systeme.io doesn't do well (e.g. complex project management, advanced reporting, or a specific integration).

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Identify the one missing feature. Is it critical (you can't deliver without it) or nice-to-have? If nice-to-have, find a workaround (e.g. use a spreadsheet for one report; use Google Docs for one doc).
2. Check Systeme.io's roadmap or support: sometimes a feature is in beta or can be requested. If it's coming soon, wait. If not, consider a hybrid: Systeme.io for CRM, funnels, email, calendar, and contracts; one other tool (e.g. ClickUp free) only for the missing piece. Minimize the number of tools.
3. If the missing feature is critical and Systeme.io won't add it: consider switching to Option B (HubSpot, ClickUp, Hello Bonsai) for that one workflow. See [HubSpot Free Setup](hubspot-free-setup.md), [ClickUp Free Setup](clickup-free-setup.md), [Hello Bonsai Setup](hello-bonsai-setup.md).
4. Don't add 5 tools to patch Option A. Either live with one gap and work around it, or switch path once and commit.

**Prevention:** Before choosing Option A, list the 3–5 things you must do (CRM, pipeline, email, calendar, contracts). Confirm Systeme.io does them. If one is weak, test it in a trial before committing.

**When to escalate:** If you've tried workarounds and still can't deliver: switch to Option B or hybrid. One migration is better than months of friction.

---

### Issue 3: Delivery is late or quality is slipping

**Causes:** You're overcommitted (too many clients or too much scope); no buffer in your calendar; you're not using your task tool (ClickUp or Systeme.io) to track due dates; client feedback is slow and blocks you.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Audit capacity: how many hours per week do you have for delivery? How many hours does each client need? If you're over capacity, either (a) reduce scope per client (fewer deliverables, same quality), (b) raise prices and keep fewer clients, or (c) add a contractor for one piece (e.g. design) and you keep strategy and client contact.
2. Set internal deadlines 2–3 days before client-facing deadlines. Use your task tool: create tasks with due dates; set reminders. Review weekly so nothing falls through the cracks.
3. If client feedback is slow: set a rule in the proposal or kickoff. "Client has 5 business days to provide feedback on drafts; after that we consider the deliverable approved or we move to the next phase." Chase once; then move on. Document in email so you're not blamed for delay.
4. Use the [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) and your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) to confirm scope. If you're doing more than scope, see "Service scope and pricing" (scope creep).

**Prevention:** Block delivery time in your calendar. Use one task tool (ClickUp or Systeme.io) and one place for client communication (email or one channel). Review capacity monthly: am I overcommitted?

**When to escalate:** If you're chronically over capacity and can't reduce scope or raise prices: you may need to fire one client (don't renew) or hire help. See [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) for when to add a contractor.

---

### Issue 4: You're not sure which path (Option A or B) to use

**Causes:** You started with one path and are second-guessing; you're mixing tools from both paths and it's messy.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Pick one path and commit for at least 4–6 weeks. Option A: [Systeme.io Setup Guide](systeme-io-setup-guide.md) — one platform for CRM, funnels, email, calendar, contracts. Option B: [HubSpot Free](hubspot-free-setup.md) + [ClickUp Free](clickup-free-setup.md) + [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) — best-of-breed. See the [Level 1 Implementation Plan](agency-level-1-plan.md) "Choosing Your Path."
2. If you're currently mixing: list what you use each tool for. If you have Systeme.io + Hello Bonsai, that's hybrid (fine). If you have Systeme.io + HubSpot + ClickUp + Hello Bonsai, you're doing both paths — pick one and migrate. Move deals and tasks to one stack; cancel or pause the other.
3. After you've committed, don't switch again unless you have a clear reason (e.g. "Systeme.io doesn't do X and I need it"). One migration is enough for Level 1.

**Prevention:** Decide Option A or B at the start of Level 1 (see [agency-level-1-plan.md](agency-level-1-plan.md) Prerequisites). Follow the guides for that path only. Don't add tools from the other path "just for one thing."

**When to escalate:** If you've committed to one path and it's still not working after 6 weeks: then consider switching. Document why (e.g. "I need X and Option A doesn't have it") so you don't flip again.

### Issue 5: Client can't access or use your tools (e.g. project space, report)

**Causes:** You're using ClickUp or Systeme.io and the client doesn't have access; or you're sending reports in a format they can't open; or they're not tech-savvy and get confused.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. For shared spaces (e.g. ClickUp list for client): invite the client as a guest with the minimum permission (e.g. view only or comment). Send a short email: "Here's your project space. You can see tasks and add comments here. No need to log in every day—I'll send updates by email."
2. For reports: send PDF or a link that works in the browser (e.g. Google Doc, Notion, or Systeme.io report link). Avoid "you need to create an account" unless necessary.
3. For kickoff: do a 5–10 min screen share to show them where things live (pipeline, project space, where to find reports). Record it or send a 3-step "how to" so they can refer back.
4. If the client refuses to use any tool: agree on one channel (e.g. email only). You update them by email; you still use your tools internally. Don't force them to log in if they're not going to.

**Prevention:** In the [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) kickoff, include "Tool access and how we'll communicate." Set expectation: "I'll send updates every [X]; you can reply by email." Keep it simple.

**When to escalate:** If the client's lack of access is blocking delivery (e.g. they must approve in the tool and they won't log in): move approval to email. "I'll send the draft by email; reply with feedback by [date]. I'll consider no reply as approved after that." Document in email.

## Billing and Contracts

### Issue 1: Late payment or client doesn't pay

**Causes:** No contract or unclear payment terms; you didn't send an invoice on time; client is slow to pay or disputing.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. If you don't have a contract: send one now (use [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) or [Systeme.io](systeme-io-setup-guide.md)). Include payment terms (e.g. Net 15, 50% upfront). Get it signed. For future clients, never start work without a signed contract and (if applicable) upfront payment.
2. Send invoices on time. If payment is "due on receipt" or "Net 15," send the invoice the day you deliver (or the day after). Set a reminder to follow up if not paid in 7 days (for Net 15).
3. Follow up politely: "Hi [Name], checking in on invoice [X] for $[amount], due [date]. Let me know if you need another copy or have questions." If still no payment after 2 follow-ups: "We need to receive payment by [date] to continue delivery. Can you confirm when we can expect payment?"
4. If they dispute: reopen the contract and scope. Did you deliver what was in scope? If yes, restate: "Per our agreement, we delivered [X]. Payment is due per contract." If they refuse to pay and you've delivered: see "When to escalate."

**Prevention:** Use [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) payment terms (e.g. 50% upfront, Net 15). Put them in every contract. Send invoices the same day you deliver. Use Hello Bonsai or Systeme.io to track Sent / Paid / Overdue.

**When to escalate:** If the client won't pay after 2–3 follow-ups and you've delivered per scope: send a formal demand (email or letter). If the amount justifies it, consider small-claims court or a lawyer. Pause delivery until payment is received unless you have a written payment plan.

---

### Issue 2: Client wants to pay late or change payment terms mid-project

**Causes:** They ask for Net 30 instead of Net 15; they want to pay at the end of the project instead of monthly; they're stretching cash flow.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Decide your policy. For Level 1 solo agency, 50% upfront + 50% on delivery (or monthly in advance) is standard. Net 15 or "due on receipt" for ongoing work is reasonable. Net 30 is a concession—only if you're okay with the delay and they're a good client.
2. If they ask for a change: "Our standard is [X]. We can do [Y] for this project if [condition]." Example: "We can do Net 30 if we have a signed amendment and you commit to payment by [date]. Going forward we'll stick to Net 15."
3. Get it in writing. Email: "Per our conversation, we're extending payment to [date]. All other terms unchanged." Or sign a short contract amendment. Don't rely on a verbal "they'll pay next month."
4. If they're already late and asking for more time: "We need payment by [date] to continue. If you need a payment plan, we can do [e.g. 2 installments over 30 days] with a signed agreement." Don't keep delivering without a clear date and written agreement.

**Prevention:** Set payment terms in the contract and repeat them in the proposal. At kickoff, confirm: "First invoice is due [date]; ongoing invoices are Net 15." If they push back early, address it before you deliver more.

**When to escalate:** If they've already been late and are asking for another extension without a written plan: pause delivery until you receive payment or a signed payment plan. Don't extend indefinitely.

### Issue 3: Scope dispute—client says "this wasn't what we agreed"

**Causes:** Vague contract or proposal; no written scope; client remembers differently; scope creep and you didn't document changes.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Reopen the contract and proposal. What is explicitly in scope? What is not? If it's not in writing, you're in a weak position. For this project: deliver what you believe was agreed and document in email. "Per our agreement, we're delivering [X]. This completes [deliverable]. If you expected something different, let's align on what's in scope for the next phase."
2. For future: every contract must have a "Scope" or "Deliverables" section. List deliverables (e.g. "4 blog posts per month, 1 strategy doc, 1 monthly report"). List exclusions (e.g. "Paid ads, design, and video are out of scope"). Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) Part 1 and Part 3. Get it signed.
3. If the client insists something was agreed verbally: "I don't have that in our written agreement. We can add it as an add-on for $X or we can keep scope as agreed for this phase and add it next month." Don't do unpaid work to avoid conflict.
4. At kickoff, send a short "Scope summary" email: "Here’s what we’re delivering this month: [list]. Anything not on this list is out of scope unless we add it." That creates a paper trail.

**Prevention:** Always have a written scope in the contract. Use the [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) kickoff to confirm scope. When the client asks for something new, say "That's out of scope—we can add it for $X" and get it in writing.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to pay because of a scope dispute and you've delivered what's in the contract: send a formal summary (what was delivered, what was in contract) and demand payment. If they still refuse, see "Late payment" (legal or small-claims).

### Issue 4: You need to fire a client or end the contract early

**Causes:** Client is abusive, wrong-fit, or consistently late on payment; or you're over capacity and need to reduce; or the relationship is toxic.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Check your contract. Is there a termination clause? (e.g. "Either party may terminate with 30 days written notice.") If yes, use it. Send written notice (email is fine): "Per our agreement, we're terminating the engagement effective [date]. We'll complete [outstanding deliverables] by [date] and send a final invoice. We're happy to help with transition."
2. If there's no termination clause: send a professional email. "We've decided to end our engagement effective [date]. We'll deliver [what's left] by [date] and send a final invoice. Thank you for the opportunity to work together." Give 2–4 weeks notice if possible so they're not stranded.
3. Don't over-explain or get into a fight. Keep it short and factual. If they ask why, you can say "We're focusing on [niche/type] / we're at capacity / we're not the right fit going forward." You don't owe a long explanation.
4. Deliver what you've committed for the notice period; send final invoice. Don't ghost or leave them mid-project without notice unless you have a serious reason (e.g. non-payment, abuse) and you've documented it.

**Prevention:** Add a termination clause to your contract (30 days notice, or "immediate for non-payment"). Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) and [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) or [Systeme.io](systeme-io-setup-guide.md) template. Know your exit before you need it.

**When to escalate:** If the client is abusive or threatens you: document everything (emails, messages). Terminate with notice per contract. If they refuse to pay for work already delivered, see "Late payment." If they threaten legal action, consult a lawyer.

### Issue 5: You're not tracking revenue and expenses and tax time is a mess

**Causes:** You're not using the [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) or any system; income and expenses are in different places; you didn't set aside tax.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Start now. Use the [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section. List income (from Hello Bonsai, Systeme.io, or bank) and expenses (platform costs, tools, marketing, contract help). Update monthly. Content spec: [Solo Budget Worksheet content spec](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet-content.md).
2. Put 25–30% of income aside for tax (adjust for your jurisdiction and rate). Open a separate savings account and transfer each time you get paid. Don't touch it until tax is due.
3. Keep receipts and invoices. Use one folder (digital or physical) for the year. When you pay for something business-related, save the receipt and note the category (tools, marketing, etc.). Your [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) and Solo Budget Worksheet help with categories.
4. If tax time is already a mess: gather all income (invoices, bank deposits) and all expenses (receipts, statements). Use a spreadsheet or an accountant. File on time even if you need an extension. Next year, use the Solo Budget Worksheet from month one.

**Prevention:** Update the Solo Budget Worksheet every month. Set a calendar reminder (e.g. first Monday of the month). Transfer tax savings every time you get paid. Use [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) for revenue goals and expense categories.

**When to escalate:** If you're behind on tax or have complex income (multiple states, international): hire an accountant or CPA. Don't guess. One-time cost now is better than penalties and interest later.
