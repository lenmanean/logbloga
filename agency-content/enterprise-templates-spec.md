## Intended Contents of the ZIP

The Enterprise Templates (ZIP) is a ready-to-use pack for enterprise sales and delivery. It aligns with the [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md), [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md), and [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md) so enterprise proposals, SOWs, partnership outlines, and board-style reports are consistent.

### File List and Purpose

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Enterprise proposal template** | 3–4 page proposal structure: summary, scope by service line (from [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md)), deliverables, team, investment, terms. Use for enterprise and RFP responses. Align with [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md). |
| **Multi-service SOW template** | SOW structure: scope by service line, deliverables, timelines, payment terms, change order process, termination. Use with [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) SLAs and governance. |
| **Partnership outline template** | Short template for partnership deals: partner type, deal structure (referral fee, revenue share, co-marketing), tracking, governance. Use with [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md). |
| **Board-style report template** | One- or two-page summary for board or investors: revenue by month, revenue by service line, pipeline value, team count, key wins, risks. Use with [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) and [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF). |
| **Enterprise kickoff agenda (optional)** | One-page agenda for enterprise client kickoff: intro, roles, scope by service line, timelines, SLAs, Q&A. Use with Enterprise Operations Framework and Enterprise Service Development playbooks. |

### Alignment with Package Content

- **Enterprise Operations Framework:** SOW should include SLAs (response time, revision limits, delivery windows) and governance (who approves scope changes). Kickoff agenda should confirm scope and SLAs.
- **Enterprise Service Development:** Proposal and SOW should list scope by service line and tier; pricing from Enterprise Service Development. Board-style report should align with revenue by service line from Scaling & Revenue Strategy.
- **Partnership Strategies:** Partnership outline should align with partner types, deal structure, and tracking from Partnership Strategies.
