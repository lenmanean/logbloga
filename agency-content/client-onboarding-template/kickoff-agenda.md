# Client Kickoff Agenda

One-page agenda for the kickoff call. Use after discovery is complete. Confirm scope and timeline with [Service Package Framework](../service-package-framework.md) scope.

---

## 1. Intro (5 min)

- Introductions (agency side: who will work on the account; client side: key contacts).
- Agenda and goals for the call: review discovery, confirm scope and timeline, set first deliverables and dates.

## 2. Review discovery (10 min)

- Recap goals, audience, and success criteria from the discovery form.
- Clarify any open questions (approval flow, timeline, key messages).
- Confirm scope: deliverables, cadence, reporting (from the package or SOW they signed).

## 3. Scope and timeline (10 min)

- **Deliverables:** What's included (e.g. content, ads, reporting) and cadence.
- **Timeline:** First deliverables date; first report or review date.
- **Process:** How you'll draft, get approval (if needed), and deliver. Who approves what.

## 4. First deliverables and dates (5 min)

- Agree on the first 2–4 deliverables and due dates.
- Access and assets: what you need from the client (logins, brand kit, etc.) and by when.
- Next step: e.g. "We'll send the access request by [date]; first deliverable by [date]."

## 5. Q&A (5–10 min)

- Open questions from the client.
- Confirm main contact and escalation path.
