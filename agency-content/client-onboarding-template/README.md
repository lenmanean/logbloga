# Client Onboarding Template

Ready-to-use pack for onboarding new agency clients. Aligns with the [Target Client Framework](../target-client-framework.md) and [First Agency Clients Guide](../agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) so every new client gets a consistent welcome, discovery, kickoff, and checklist.

## What's in this pack

- **welcome-email.md** — Short email sent when the client signs; thank you, next step, link to discovery.
- **discovery-questionnaire.md** — 5–10 questions (goals, audience, timeline, who approves); use answers in kickoff and delivery.
- **kickoff-agenda.md** — One-page agenda for the kickoff call: intro, review discovery, confirm scope and timeline, first deliverables, Q&A.
- **onboarding-checklist.md** — Checklist for you (agency): contract signed, invoice sent/paid, discovery done, kickoff held, first deliverables scheduled, client in CRM.

## How to use

1. After close: send the welcome email and discovery form link.
2. Once discovery is complete: schedule kickoff and use the kickoff agenda.
3. After kickoff: confirm scope and first deliverables; use the onboarding checklist so nothing is missed.
4. Align discovery questions with [Target Client Framework](../target-client-framework.md) (goals, pain points) and scope with [Service Package Framework](../service-package-framework.md).
