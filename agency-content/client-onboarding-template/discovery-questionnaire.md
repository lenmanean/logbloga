# Discovery Questionnaire

Use these questions before the kickoff call so you can confirm scope and set first deliverables. Align with [Target Client Framework](../target-client-framework.md) (goals, pain points, demographics). Use answers in the kickoff and in delivery.

---

## 1. Goals and context

- What are your top 2–3 goals for this engagement? (e.g. brand awareness, leads, retention)
- Who is your primary audience? (industry, role, size)
- What does success look like in 90 days? In 6 months?

## 2. Current state

- What are you doing today (in-house, previous agency, DIY)? What's working and what isn't?
- Any key messages, tone, or topics we should follow or avoid?
- Competitors or references we should be aware of?

## 3. Scope and timeline

- What's in scope for this engagement? (e.g. channels, deliverables, reporting)
- What's your timeline for the first deliverables?
- Any hard deadlines or events we need to plan around?

## 4. Approval and contact

- Who approves work (posts, reports, campaigns) before it goes live or to stakeholders?
- What's the preferred turnaround time for approvals?
- Who is the main day-to-day contact? Who should we escalate to if needed?

## 5. Anything else

- Is there anything else we should know before the kickoff call?

**Next step:** Schedule the kickoff once responses are received. Use [kickoff-agenda.md](kickoff-agenda.md) for the call.
