**Subject:** Welcome — next step: [Discovery form / Kickoff]

Hi [Client name],

Thank you for signing on. We're excited to get started.

**What happens next:**

1. **Complete the discovery form** by [date]. This helps us align on your goals, audience, and timeline so the kickoff call is productive. [Link to discovery form or questionnaire.]

2. **Once we receive your responses**, we'll schedule the kickoff call (30–45 min). We'll review your answers, confirm scope and timeline, and set the first deliverables and dates.

3. **After kickoff**, we'll send access and brand details we need and lock in the first delivery dates.

If you have any questions before then, reply to this email or book a short call [calendar link].

Looking forward to working with you.

[Your name]
