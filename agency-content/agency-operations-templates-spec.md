## Intended Contents of the ZIP

The Agency Operations Templates (ZIP) is a ready-to-use pack for running client delivery and team operations. It aligns with the [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) so every client gets consistent kickoff, status, client review, and handoff.

### File List and Purpose

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Kickoff agenda** | One-page agenda for the client kickoff call: intro, roles (who does what), review discovery/scope, confirm timeline and first deliverables, Q&A. Use with [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) playbooks and [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) (who owns kickoff). |
| **Status report template** | Short template for biweekly or monthly client status: deliverables completed, metrics (if applicable), blockers, next 2 weeks. Use with [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) touchpoints. Owner: Account manager per Team Management. |
| **Client review template** | Template for quarterly or milestone client review: results vs goals, roadmap, feedback, upsell opportunity. Use with [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) (QBR) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) (tier and add-ons). |
| **Handoff checklist** | Internal checklist for phase or project handoff: deliverables approved, client sign-off, next phase or renewal date, tasks closed in ClickUp (or equivalent). Use with [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) (Delivery → Client and Feedback → Delivery). |
| **Renewal conversation guide** | Short script or bullet points for the 45-day and 30-day renewal check-in: how are we doing, what's next, renewal offer. Use with [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) renewal process and [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md). |

### Alignment with Package Content

- **Team Management Framework:** Kickoff agenda should name roles (Owner, Delivery lead, Account manager). Status and review templates should have a clear owner. Handoff checklist should match handoff steps (who passes what to whom).
- **Service Suite Development:** Kickoff should confirm scope and tier; status and review should reference deliverables and tier. Client review should tie to upsell (tier or add-on).
- **Client Retention Strategies:** Status report = regular touchpoint; client review = QBR or milestone review. Renewal guide = renewal process. Health signals can be noted in status or review (e.g. "Client feedback: on time / delayed").
