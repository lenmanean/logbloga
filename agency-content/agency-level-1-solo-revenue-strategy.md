# Solo Revenue Strategy

How to plan and track revenue so you can reach $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency.

## Purpose

A clear revenue strategy (revenue goals, package mix, pricing floor, when to raise rates, expense categories) keeps you on track to $2,000–$5,000/month at Level 1. For solo agency (3–4 weeks time investment, $100–300 platform costs), this guide helps you set goals, choose package mix, set a pricing floor, and know when to raise rates. Use with the [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section. Without it, you'll undercharge or overcommit and burn out.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes initial; 30 minutes monthly review  
- **When:** Use in Phase 1 (with [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md)) and Phase 4 of the [Implementation Plan](agency-level-1-plan.md); update monthly with the Solo Budget Worksheet (PDF).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft a simple revenue model ("I need $3k/month; my packages are $1.2k and $2.2k; how many clients do I need?"); then personalize.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in proposals and in the [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF).

## Part 1: Revenue Goals and Package Mix

### What you're aiming for and how you'll get there

**Revenue goal (Level 1 band: $2,000–$5,000/month):**
_________________________________________________

**Package mix (which packages you'll sell and at what price):**
- Package 1: _________________________________________________ at $_________/month  
- Package 2: _________________________________________________ at $_________/month  
- Package 3 (optional): _________________________________________________ at $_________/month  

**Simple revenue model (e.g. X clients × $Y = target):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Goal: $3,000/month. Package mix: Starter $1,200, Growth $2,200. Model: 1 Growth + 1 Starter = $3,400, or 2 Growth = $4,400. I need 2 clients at Growth or 1 Growth + 1 Starter to hit $3k."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Revenue goal written; [ ] Package mix and revenue model clear; [ ] Aligned with [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md)

## Part 2: Pricing Floor and When to Raise Rates

### Minimum price and when to increase

**Pricing floor (below this you won't take a client):**
$_________/month (or $_________ one-time minimum)

**When to raise rates:**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. at renewal after 6 months; when you add a case study; when you're at 90% capacity.)

**How you'll communicate a raise:**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. "We're raising rates to $X/month starting [date] to reflect our current scope and market. Your current rate is locked until [renewal date].")

**Example:** "Floor: $1,000/month. I'll raise at renewal after 6 months or when I add a case study. I'll say: 'We're raising to $X starting [date]; your rate is locked until [renewal].'"

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pricing floor set; [ ] You know when and how you'll raise; [ ] You won't take clients below floor without a written pilot (e.g. case study in exchange)

## Part 3: Expense Categories

### What you'll track so net is clear

**Platform costs (Level 1 range: $100–300/month):**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. Systeme.io $X, Hello Bonsai $X, Canva $X.)

**Other expenses (tools, marketing, contract help):**
_________________________________________________

**Tax set-aside (e.g. 25–30% of income):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Platform: Systeme.io $97, Hello Bonsai $25 = $122/month. Other: Canva $15, domain $1 = $16. Tax: 28% of income set aside each month."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Expense categories listed; [ ] You're tracking in [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF); [ ] Tax set-aside is automatic (transfer when you get paid)

## Part 4: Monthly Review

### What to check every month

- [ ] **Revenue:** Total revenue vs last month and vs goal ($2k–$5k band). Use [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF).
- [ ] **Costs:** Platform and other expenses. Are they in line with budget ($100–300 platform)?
- [ ] **Pipeline:** How many proposals out, how many calls booked. If pipeline is dry, restart outreach (see [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md)).
- [ ] **Pricing:** Any client at or below your floor? Plan a conversation at renewal or when you add proof (case study).
- [ ] **Capacity:** Are you at 90%+ capacity? If yes, either raise prices or stop taking new clients until you have room.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Monthly review on calendar; [ ] Revenue and costs tracked in Solo Budget Worksheet (PDF)
