# Small Team Agency — Implementation Plan

Step-by-step roadmap for scaling to a 2–5 person team and reaching $5,000–$15,000/month.

## Overview

This implementation plan guides you through scaling from solo agency to small team agency over 6–8 weeks. You'll add GoHighLevel (Option A) or HubSpot paid, ClickUp paid, and Zite (Option B); Team Management and Service Suite Development frameworks; Client Retention Strategies; and scaling acquisition so you can manage 5–10 clients with a 2–5 person team and reach $5,000–$15,000/month.

**Who this is for:** Agency leads with or building a 2–5 person team aiming for $5,000–$15,000/month—with Option A or B platforms in use, team management and service suite formalized, client retention in place, and 5–10 clients or pipeline. AI leverage (ChatGPT, Claude, workflow automation) scales delivery so you don't burn out.

**Expected outcome:** GoHighLevel or Option B stack in use; Team Management Framework and Service Suite Development completed; Client Retention Strategies in use; 5–10 clients or pipeline; Agency Operations Templates (ZIP) in use; Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy and Team Budget Planner in use. Platform costs in the $300–800/month range for Level 2.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Level 1 complete or equivalent** (niche, service packages, target client, first clients, solo systems in place)
- **Option A (recommended) or Option B:** [GoHighLevel](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) (all-in-one) or [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md), [ClickUp paid](clickup-paid-setup.md), [Zite](zite-setup-guide.md) (best-of-breed)

**Platform setup:** For step-by-step setup, use the Platform Setup Guides in this level: [GoHighLevel Setup Guide](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) (Option A, recommended), [HubSpot Paid Setup](hubspot-paid-setup.md), [ClickUp Paid Setup](clickup-paid-setup.md), [Zite Setup Guide](zite-setup-guide.md) (Option B). Follow **one path**; all four guides are available so you can choose.

### Choosing Your Path

- **Pick Option A (GoHighLevel)** if you want one platform for CRM, pipelines, automation, calendar, campaigns, and reporting so a 2–5 person team can run 5–10 clients. Recommended for speed and team collaboration.
- **Pick Option B (HubSpot paid + ClickUp paid + Zite)** if you prefer best-in-class sales/marketing (HubSpot), team tasks (ClickUp), and client deliverables/approvals (Zite). Best if you already use one of these or need specific features.

## Working with AI Tools

AI can support proposal drafts, process documentation, report summaries, and team communication templates so you scale delivery without sacrificing quality.

### For Non-Technical Users

**Effective use of AI:**
- **Proposal drafts:** "We're a [niche] agency with a 2–5 person team. Our service suite is [brief]. Write a 2-page proposal structure with summary, scope, deliverables, team, and investment. Tone: professional."
- **Process docs:** "Document our client onboarding steps: welcome, contract, kickoff, first deliverable. Use bullet points and 1–2 sentences per step." Edit for your actual process.
- **Report summaries:** Paste metrics and ask AI for a 2–3 sentence summary for the client report. You approve and send.

**When to do it yourself:** Strategy, hiring, client relationships, and final approval. AI drafts; you own the relationship and the decision.

### For All Users

**Use AI for:** Proposal drafts, process documentation, report summaries, team communication templates (e.g. status update format). Always review and personalize AI output before sending to clients or team.

**Do yourself:** Strategy, hiring, client relationships, pricing, and team management. Keep relationships and key decisions human.
