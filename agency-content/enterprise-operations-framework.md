# Enterprise Operations Framework

Guided exercises to define governance, SLAs, multi-service delivery, and escalation so your 5+ person team can run 10+ clients and multiple service lines—supporting $15,000–$50,000+/month at Level 3. **Most detailed** framework in the Agency package: longest "How to use," most granular parts, **3+ worked examples**.

## Purpose

Clear enterprise operations (governance, SLAs, multi-service delivery, escalation) prevent scope creep, missed SLAs, and client churn at scale. For Level 3 established multi-service agency ($15,000–$50,000+/month, 12–16 weeks, $800–2,000 platform costs), defining who approves what, what you promise clients (response time, revision limits, delivery windows), how delivery runs per service line, and when to escalate keeps 10+ clients and 5+ people aligned. Without it, delivery is inconsistent and clients lose trust.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 90–120 minutes (longest framework in the package)  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 1 of the [Level 3 Implementation Plan](agency-level-3-plan.md) (Enterprise Positioning and Platforms); align with [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md), [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md), [GoHighLevel Enterprise Setup](gohighlevel-enterprise-setup.md), and [Enterprise Platform Setup](enterprise-platform-setup.md). Use in [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) and SOWs.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft "agency governance and SLAs for 5+ person team" or "multi-service delivery playbook structure"; then customize for your service lines and clients.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in SOWs, kickoff agendas, and the [Enterprise Operations Issues](agency-level-3-enterprise-operations-issues.md) troubleshooting guide.

## Part 1: Governance (Who Approves What)

### Who can commit the agency (scope, price, contract)

**Scope and price (who can agree to scope or price changes):**
_________________________________________________

**Contract and legal (who signs contracts, amendments, NDAs):**
_________________________________________________

**Escalation (when and how issues escalate to Owner or legal):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Scope and price: Owner or designated Account director. Contract and legal: Owner only. Escalation: scope dispute or client conflict → Account director then Owner; legal or liability → Owner and (if needed) lawyer."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Scope/price owner clear; [ ] Contract/legal owner clear; [ ] Escalation path documented

---

## Part 2: SLAs (What You Promise Clients)

### Response time, revision limits, delivery windows

**Response time (e.g. within 1 business day for emails; within 24 hours for urgent):**
_________________________________________________

**Revision limits (e.g. 2 rounds per deliverable; additional rounds at $X):**
_________________________________________________

**Delivery windows (e.g. first deliverable within 10 business days of kickoff; monthly deliverables by 5th of month):**
_________________________________________________

**Where SLAs are documented (contract, SOW, client-facing doc):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Response: 1 business day for non-urgent; 24 hours for urgent (client must label 'Urgent'). Revisions: 2 rounds per deliverable; round 3+ at $Y per round. Delivery: first deliverable 10 business days post-kickoff; monthly deliverables by 5th. Documented in SOW and client welcome doc."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Response time, revision limits, delivery windows set; [ ] Documented in contract or SOW; [ ] Team trained on SLAs

## Part 3: Multi-Service Delivery (Per Service Line)

### How delivery runs for each service line (phases, owners, timelines)

**Service line 1 (e.g. Content & SEO):**
- Phases: _________________________________________________
- Owner (Delivery lead or equivalent): _________________________________________________
- Timeline (e.g. Phase 1 in 2 weeks; Phase 2 in 4 weeks): _________________________________________________

**Service line 2 (e.g. Paid Media):**
- Phases: _________________________________________________
- Owner: _________________________________________________
- Timeline: _________________________________________________

**Service line 3 (if applicable):**
- Phases: _________________________________________________
- Owner: _________________________________________________
- Timeline: _________________________________________________

**Handoff between service lines (if a client has multiple lines):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Content & SEO: Phase 1 Strategy (2 weeks), Phase 2 First content (2 weeks), Phase 3 Ongoing + report (monthly). Owner: Content lead. Paid Media: Phase 1 Strategy + setup (2 weeks), Phase 2 Launch (1 week), Phase 3 Optimize + report (monthly). Owner: Paid lead. Handoff: Account manager owns client; Delivery leads coordinate if client has both lines."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Phases and owners per service line; [ ] Timelines documented; [ ] Handoff between lines clear; [ ] Align with [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md)

## Part 4: Escalation and Offboarding

### When to escalate and how to offboard

**Escalation triggers (e.g. scope dispute, SLA breach, client conflict, legal risk):**
_________________________________________________

**Escalation path (who gets involved, in what order):**
_________________________________________________

**Offboarding (when and how to end a client relationship):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Escalation: scope dispute or SLA breach → Account director; client conflict or legal risk → Owner. Path: Delivery lead → Account director → Owner (and legal if needed). Offboarding: 30 days notice per contract; handoff doc (what was delivered, what's in progress); final invoice and sign-off. Owner approves offboarding and any settlement."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Escalation triggers and path documented; [ ] Offboarding process clear; [ ] Owner approves offboarding

## Worked Example 1: Multi-Service Agency (Content, Paid, Strategy)

**Governance:** Owner approves scope and price; Owner signs contracts. Account director can approve add-ons under $X. Escalation: Delivery lead → Account director → Owner.

**SLAs:** Response 1 business day; 2 revision rounds per deliverable; first deliverable 10 business days post-kickoff; monthly deliverables by 5th. In SOW and welcome doc.

**Multi-service:** Content & SEO: Strategy → First content → Ongoing (Content lead). Paid: Strategy + setup → Launch → Optimize (Paid lead). Strategy: Discovery → Strategy doc → Quarterly review (Owner or Strategy lead). Handoff: Account manager owns client; leads coordinate for multi-line clients.

**Escalation:** Scope/SLA → Account director; conflict/legal → Owner. Offboarding: 30 days notice, handoff doc, final invoice, Owner approval.

---

## Worked Example 2: Enterprise-First Agency (ABM, RFP, High-Touch)

**Governance:** Owner approves all scope, price, and contracts. Account director can approve change orders under $Y. Escalation: Account manager → Account director → Owner; RFP and legal → Owner and legal.

**SLAs:** Response 24 hours for enterprise; 2 revision rounds; first deliverable 15 business days (enterprise); monthly or quarterly deliverables per SOW. In SOW and RFP response.

**Multi-service:** ABM: Audience → Campaign → Optimize (ABM lead). RFP delivery: Kickoff → Phases per SOW → Sign-off (Delivery lead + Owner for key milestones). Handoff: Account director owns enterprise client; Delivery lead runs delivery; Owner joins key reviews.

**Escalation:** Any enterprise issue → Account director; RFP or legal → Owner. Offboarding: Per contract (often 60–90 days notice for enterprise); handoff doc; final report; Owner and legal approval.

---

## Worked Example 3: Scaling Agency (5–8 People, 3 Service Lines)

**Governance:** Owner: scope, price, contracts, legal. Delivery director: day-to-day delivery and SLA. Account directors: client-facing scope and renewal. Escalation: Delivery lead → Delivery director; Account manager → Account director; conflict/legal → Owner.

**SLAs:** Response 1 business day; 2 rounds per deliverable (3rd at $Z); first deliverable 10 business days; monthly by 5th. By tier: Premium gets 24-hour response and optional 3rd round included. In SOW and client tier doc.

**Multi-service:** Line 1 (Content): Content lead. Line 2 (Paid): Paid lead. Line 3 (Creative): Creative lead. Delivery director allocates capacity; Account director owns client relationship. Handoff: Account director coordinates; Delivery director resolves capacity conflicts.

**Escalation:** SLA or scope → Delivery director or Account director; capacity or conflict → Owner. Offboarding: 30 days notice; handoff doc; final invoice; Owner approves.
