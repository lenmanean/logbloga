# Service Suite Development

Guided exercises to define service tiers, pricing, and delivery playbooks so your 2–5 person team can scale to 5–10 clients—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month at Level 2.

## Purpose

A clear service suite (tiers, pricing, delivery playbooks) lets you sell and deliver consistently at scale. For Level 2 small team agency ($5,000–$15,000/month, 6–8 weeks, $300–800 platform costs), defining what you offer at each tier, how much you charge, and how delivery runs (playbooks) prevents scope creep and undercharging. Without it, every deal is custom and delivery is chaotic.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 75–90 minutes  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 1 of the [Level 2 Implementation Plan](agency-level-2-plan.md) (Platforms and Team Structure); align with [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) and [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md). Use in [GoHighLevel](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) or [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md) pipeline stages and [ClickUp](clickup-paid-setup.md) templates.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to research "agency service tiers [niche] pricing" or "delivery playbook template"; then customize for your team size and services.

## Part 3: Delivery Playbooks (Fill-In)

### How delivery runs for each tier (phases, owners, timelines)

**Kickoff (all tiers):**  
Steps: _________________________________________________  
Owner: _________________________________________________  
Timeline (e.g. within 5 business days of signed contract): _________________________________________________

**Ongoing delivery (e.g. monthly):**  
Steps: _________________________________________________  
Owner: _________________________________________________  
Timeline: _________________________________________________

**Review and handoff (per phase or per month):**  
Steps: _________________________________________________  
Owner: _________________________________________________  
Timeline: _________________________________________________

**Example:** "Kickoff: Contract signed → Account manager sends welcome + kickoff agenda → Delivery lead runs kickoff call → Tasks created in ClickUp (per tier template) → First deliverable due in 10 days. Ongoing: Delivery lead assigns tasks; Specialist executes; Delivery lead or Account manager sends to client via Zite; client feedback in 5 days; revisions in 5 days. Review: Monthly status report (Account manager); quarterly business review for Growth/Premium (Account manager + Owner)."

_________________________________________________

**Templates you use (kickoff, status, client review):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Stages: Lead, Qualified, Proposal sent, Negotiation, Closed won, Onboarded, In delivery, Renewal. Tier mapping: Starters often first-time buyers; Growth/Premium from referrals or upsell. Templates: Kickoff agenda (all), Status report (all, monthly), Client review (Growth/Premium, quarterly).

## Worked Example 1: Content and SEO Agency (3 Tiers)

**Tiers:** Starter (2 blog + 4 social + report, $1,600/mo), Growth (4 blog + 8 social + strategy + report + 1 call, $2,900/mo), Premium (Growth + priority + 2 calls + custom, $4,200/mo).

**Pricing rationale:** Starter: volume-based, 2 clients per delivery lead. Growth: core margin, 2–3 clients. Premium: high margin, 1–2 clients, more Owner touch.

**Playbooks:** Kickoff: welcome email, kickoff call, strategy doc (Growth/Premium), first content in 2 weeks. Ongoing: content calendar, draft → review → client approval (Zite), publish + report. Monthly status; quarterly review for Growth/Premium.

**Pipeline:** Stages align with Team Management handoffs; tier in deal property for reporting.

## Worked Example 2: Full-Service Marketing Agency (3 Tiers)

**Tiers:** Foundation (ads + basic creative + report, $2,200/mo), Core (Foundation + content + email + 1 call, $4,000/mo), Scale (Core + strategy + 2 calls + dedicated contact, $6,500/mo).

**Pricing rationale:** Foundation: entry, 3–4 clients per lead. Core: main revenue, 2–3 clients. Scale: premium, 1–2 clients, account manager focus.

**Playbooks:** Kickoff: onboarding form, creative brief, audience/targeting review, first campaign in 2 weeks. Ongoing: campaign build → review → launch → optimize; monthly report and call. Scale gets biweekly call and quarterly strategy refresh.

**Pipeline:** Same stage logic; tier and contract value in deal; renewal task 45 days out (Account manager).
