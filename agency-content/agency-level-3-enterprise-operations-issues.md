# Enterprise Operations Issues

Common issues and solutions for established multi-service agency operations ($15,000–$50,000+/month). **Most comprehensive** troubleshooting in the Agency package: minimum **5–6 issues per section**. For each issue: causes, step-by-step resolution, prevention, and when to escalate.

---

## Enterprise Positioning and Pricing

### Issue 1: Enterprise positioning is vague or doesn't match multi-service offer

**Causes:** Website or proposal says "we do marketing" or lists services that don't match your [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) lines. Enterprise buyers can't tell why they should choose you over a competitor.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Align positioning with [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) Part 4 (positioning vs competitors). Write one sentence: "We help [ideal enterprise client] achieve [outcome] through [service lines]. We're different because [differentiator]." Use it on website, proposal summary, and [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md).
2. Audit website, proposal template, and outreach: remove generic language; add service lines and proof (case studies by line). Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) enterprise proposal template.
3. Train team: only use the approved positioning in proposals and outreach. Document in [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) or internal playbook.
4. Test with 2–3 enterprise buyers (or partners): "What do we do? Who do we serve?" Refine until they answer correctly.

**Prevention:** One "master" positioning doc (sentence + paragraph + proof). Update when you add a service line or pivot. Review quarterly.

**When to escalate:** If you've aligned positioning and still get no traction after 20–30 quality enterprise touches: consider a positioning or messaging audit with a mentor or consultant who knows enterprise sales.

---

### Issue 2: Enterprise pricing is too low and margin is thin

**Causes:** You undercut to win RFPs or enterprise deals; you didn't factor in delivery cost, team cost, and platform cost. Margin is below target.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Calculate your cost per delivery (team cost, platform cost, contractor cost) per service line. Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) and [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF). Set a **minimum margin** (e.g. 25–35% after delivery cost). Don't take deals below that margin unless strategic (e.g. case study, reference, entry into vertical).
2. Raise prices for **new** enterprise deals: use [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) Part 2 (pricing by line and tier). Update proposal template and SOW template. Stop quoting old rates.
3. For **existing** undercharging clients: at renewal, propose a raise or reduced scope to match price. "We're adjusting our pricing to reflect our current scope and market. New rate: $X/month starting [date]. Your current rate is locked until [renewal]." Get it in writing (amendment or new contract).
4. Document pricing floor and margin target in [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md). Review monthly so the team doesn't quote below floor.

**Prevention:** Pricing floor and margin target in Scaling & Revenue Strategy. Every proposal reviewed for margin before send. Renewal process includes price review (see [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md)).

**When to escalate:** If the team keeps quoting below floor to "win the deal": Owner must enforce. "We don't take deals below $X margin. If the prospect can't afford it, we pass or reduce scope."

---

### Issue 3: Enterprise buyers say "too expensive" and you don't know how to respond

**Causes:** No script or framework for handling price objection; team drops price without getting something in return.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Clarify:** "What would need to be true for this to be a yes? Is it the total number, payment terms, or scope?" Sometimes it's payment terms (e.g. monthly vs upfront) or scope (e.g. start with one line), not the number.
2. **Don't drop price without getting something.** Options: (a) reduce scope to match their budget (fewer deliverables, one service line first); (b) extend term (e.g. 12-month commitment for 10% off); (c) get something in return (case study, reference, testimonial, pilot at full price for 3 months then review). Document in partner or client agreement.
3. **Use proof.** "Here's what [similar client] achieved at this investment: [result]. We can start with [reduced scope] at $X and expand when you see results." Use [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) case studies.
4. **Be willing to walk.** If they can't afford your floor and won't agree to scope reduction or term: "We're not the right fit at this budget. I'm happy to refer you to [alternative] or revisit when your budget allows." Don't chase bad-fit deals.

**Prevention:** Price objection script in [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md) or internal playbook. Train team: never drop price without Owner approval and without getting something in return.

**When to escalate:** If the prospect insists on a price you can't support: Owner makes final call (pass or one-time exception with written terms).

---

### Issue 4: RFP responses are inconsistent or miss requirements

**Causes:** No RFP response process; different people write different sections; requirements or questions are missed.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **RFP process.** Document in [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) or internal playbook: (1) Triage (fit, timeline, budget); (2) Assign owner (Owner or Account director) and delivery lead(s); (3) Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) enterprise proposal template; (4) Answer every question with same numbering; (5) Review for completeness and margin before submit; (6) Submit with buffer; (7) Follow up; (8) Win/lose review.
2. **Checklist.** Create an RFP response checklist: all questions answered, pricing in required format, case studies attached, team bios attached, legal/insurance docs attached (if required). Owner or Account director signs off before submit.
3. **If you've already missed requirements:** Note for next RFP. If the client asks for clarification or resubmit, provide the missing piece quickly and professionally. Don't blame; fix the process.
4. **Win/lose review.** After each RFP: what worked, what didn't, what to do differently. Update template and checklist. Share with team so the next response is better.

**Prevention:** RFP process and checklist mandatory. One owner per RFP. Template and checklist updated after each RFP. Win/lose review within 1 week of decision.

**When to escalate:** If RFPs keep failing for the same reason (e.g. pricing, scope, team slide): Owner leads a workshop to fix the root cause (positioning, pricing, or process).

---

### Issue 5: Enterprise proposal is too long or too generic

**Causes:** Proposal is 30+ pages with no executive summary; prospect can't find the key message or differentiator. Or proposal is generic ("we do great work") with no proof or customization.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Executive summary (1 page).** Lead with: who you are, what you do for companies like them, why you're a fit (one sentence), key proof (one case study or result), investment (range or number), next step. Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) enterprise proposal template.
2. **Customize.** Use their company name, industry, and one observation (e.g. "You're scaling [X]; we've helped [similar company] do that with [service line]."). Add 1–2 relevant case studies (same industry or same service line). Remove boilerplate that doesn't apply.
3. **Keep full proposal scannable.** Use headings, bullet points, and a table of contents. Length depends on RFP (often 10–20 pages); but executive summary is always 1 page and at the front.
4. **Proof.** Every proposal must have at least 2 case studies (by line or industry) and 1 testimonial. Use [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) Part 4. No proposal goes out without proof.

**Prevention:** Enterprise proposal template with 1-page executive summary. Proposal review before send: customized? Proof included? Length appropriate? Owner or Account director signs off.

**When to escalate:** If the team keeps sending generic or overlong proposals: Owner reviews next 3 proposals before send and provides feedback. Add proposal review to RFP checklist.

---

### Issue 6: You're competing on price in enterprise and losing to cheaper bidders

**Causes:** You're positioning as "affordable" or you're not differentiating on value. Enterprise buyer chooses the lower bid.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Differentiate on value, not price.** Lead with: outcome (e.g. "We help enterprises grow pipeline 30% in 6 months"), proof (case studies, results), and one differentiator (e.g. "One team, one point of contact; no juggling three vendors"). Use [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md) positioning statements.
2. **Qualify.** If the prospect is only comparing on price, they may not be a fit. Ask: "What matters most—outcome, team, or price?" If they say only price, consider passing or offering a reduced scope at your floor.
3. **Add value to the offer.** Include something competitors don't (e.g. strategy call, quarterly business review, dedicated Account director). Document in [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) and in the proposal. Justify the price with scope and value.
4. **Track win/loss.** When you lose to a cheaper bidder, note it. If you're losing more than 50% on price, either your positioning is weak or you're targeting too price-sensitive a segment. Consider narrowing to buyers who value outcome and relationship over lowest bid.

**Prevention:** Never lead with "we're affordable" or "we're competitive on price." Lead with outcome, proof, and differentiator. Qualify prospects on value fit. Win/loss review monthly.

**When to escalate:** If you're losing every enterprise deal on price: Owner leads a review. Consider repositioning, narrowing segment, or improving proof (case studies, testimonials) so you can command premium.

## Multi-Service Delivery and Scope

### Issue 1: Scope creep across service lines—client expects more than SOW

**Causes:** Vague SOW or proposal; no clear "out of scope" per line; team said yes to one-off requests without updating scope or price.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Document scope and exclusions using [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) and [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md). In every SOW and contract: list deliverables by service line; add "Out of scope: [list]. Add-ons available: [list and price]." Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) multi-service SOW template.
2. When the client asks for something new: "That's outside our current scope. We can add it as an add-on for $X or as a change order for $Y." Get agreement in writing (email or amendment). Account director or Owner responds; Delivery leads don't promise scope without approval.
3. If you've already been doing extra work: Account director schedules a call. "We've been doing [X] which wasn't in the original SOW. Going forward we'd like to add it formally for $Z so we can keep delivering at this level." Be polite and firm. Get it in an amendment.
4. At renewal, compare what you're delivering to what you're charging. If scope has grown, adjust price or add an add-on. Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md).

**Prevention:** Every new client: clear scope in SOW and contract. Use Enterprise Templates SOW template. Kickoff confirms scope per line. One person (Account director or Owner) owns scope conversations. Document in Enterprise Operations Framework.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to pay for added scope or threatens to leave: Owner decides whether to hold the line or make a one-time exception. If it becomes a pattern, consider ending the contract at renewal or adding a formal change-order process.

---

### Issue 2: Different service lines conflict on priority or capacity

**Causes:** Client has multiple lines (e.g. Content and Paid); both lines need the same resource or same deadline; no prioritization or governance.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Single point of contact.** Account director owns the client; they prioritize with the client. "This month we have [deliverable A] and [deliverable B]. Which is higher priority?" Get the client to choose or agree on order. Document in kickoff or SOW: "Account director owns prioritization; client confirms order when there's conflict."
2. **Capacity.** Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) and [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md). If Delivery lead A (Content) and Delivery lead B (Paid) are both at capacity, don't promise the same deadline for both. Account director sets expectation: "We can do A by [date] and B by [date] if we prioritize A first." Or add capacity (see Team scaling section).
3. **Internal handoff.** When a client has multiple lines, Delivery leads coordinate (e.g. weekly sync or shared task view). Account director joins if there's conflict. Document in Enterprise Operations Framework Part 3 (multi-service delivery).
4. **If you're already in conflict:** Account director meets with client and both Delivery leads. Agree on priority and new dates. Communicate in writing. Don't let both lines slip; fix the process for next time.

**Prevention:** Account director owns client prioritization. Multi-service handoff documented in Enterprise Operations Framework. Capacity check before committing to new deliverables. Weekly or biweekly internal sync for multi-line clients.

**When to escalate:** If the same client keeps causing conflict: Owner joins a call to set expectation (prioritization, capacity, or scope reduction). If the client won't prioritize, consider whether the account is manageable.

---

### Issue 3: SLA breach—you missed response time, revision limit, or delivery window

**Causes:** No SLA tracking; team didn't know the SLA; overload or poor prioritization.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Document SLAs** in [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) Part 2 and in the SOW. Train team: response time (e.g. 1 business day), revision limits (e.g. 2 rounds per deliverable), delivery windows (e.g. first deliverable 10 business days post-kickoff). Put in client welcome doc or kickoff summary.
2. **Track.** Use your task tool or CRM: due dates for deliverables; reply dates for client feedback. If you're approaching a breach (e.g. 2 days left and deliverable isn't ready), Account director or Delivery lead proactively emails client: "We're running 2 days behind on [deliverable]. New date: [date]. We're sorry for the delay." Don't wait until the breach to communicate.
3. **If you've already breached:** Apologize immediately. "We missed our [SLA]. Here's the revised date: [date]. We're sorry and here's what we're doing to prevent it: [brief action]." Deliver on the new date. Do a short post-mortem: why did we miss? (capacity, scope creep, handoff?) Fix the cause.
4. **Recurring breach.** If the same SLA keeps breaking (e.g. always late on first deliverable): fix capacity or process. Add buffer to the SLA (e.g. "10 business days" → "12 business days") if you consistently need it; or add capacity so you can hit 10 days. Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md).

**Prevention:** SLAs in SOW and internal playbook. Team trained on SLAs. Due dates in task tool; owner reviews weekly. Proactive communication if at risk of breach. Post-mortem after any breach.

**When to escalate:** If SLA breaches are chronic: Owner reviews capacity and process. You may need more buffer, more capacity, or scope reduction. If the client is at risk of churning: Account director or Owner joins to stabilize and reset expectation.

### Issue 4: Client is unhappy with quality but won't specify what's wrong

**Causes:** Vague feedback ("it's not what we wanted"); no structured feedback process; multiple stakeholders with conflicting views.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Structured feedback.** Use a short form or template: "What works? What needs to change? Specific edits (if any)." Send with every deliverable. Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) or client approval tool (e.g. Zite). "Please reply with feedback by [date] using this format."
2. **Single point of contact for feedback.** Per [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md), identify one client contact who consolidates feedback. Account director: "We need one set of consolidated feedback so we can revise efficiently. Who on your side can own that?"
3. **Call.** Account director or Delivery lead schedules 15–30 min: "We want to make sure we nail the next deliverable. Can you walk us through what wasn't right and what good looks like?" Take notes; turn into a brief or checklist for the next round. Document "client preferences" in CRM or client folder.
4. **If they still won't specify:** "We need one or two specific examples (e.g. 'Section 2 felt off' or 'tone was too formal') so we can fix it. Can you point to one thing we can change for the next one?" Don't keep guessing. If they refuse to engage, document and consider escalation (Owner) or offboarding (see Enterprise Operations Framework Part 4).

**Prevention:** Structured feedback format with every deliverable. Single point of contact for feedback identified at kickoff. After any quality complaint: 15–30 min call to get specifics; document preferences. Add preferences to client folder.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to give specifics and keeps saying "just make it better": Owner joins a call to set expectation. "We need specific feedback to improve. Without it, we're guessing." If they still won't engage: consider whether the relationship is salvageable; document for potential offboarding.

---

### Issue 5: Multi-service handoff from sales to delivery is messy

**Causes:** Deal closes but no one creates kickoff, adds client to task tool, or assigns Delivery leads per line. Client is left waiting; delivery doesn't know scope.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Define handoff** in [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) Part 3 and [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md). When deal moves to "Closed won": who creates kickoff (Account director), who adds client to task tool (Account director or Delivery lead), who runs kickoff (Account director + Delivery lead(s) per line). Complete within 5 business days of signed contract.
2. **Checklist.** Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) enterprise kickoff agenda. Checklist: contract signed → welcome sent → kickoff scheduled → kickoff held → tasks created per line → first deliverable dates set. Account director owns completion.
3. **If client is already waiting:** Apologize; send welcome and kickoff invite within 24 hours; run kickoff within 5 days. Backfill tasks and dates. Document the checklist so you don't skip steps next time.
4. **Automation (optional).** In [GoHighLevel Enterprise](gohighlevel-enterprise-setup.md) or equivalent: when deal moves to "Closed won," create task "Create kickoff for [Client name]" assigned to Account director. Reduces chance of drop.

**Prevention:** Handoff checklist mandatory for every new client. Account director owns checklist. Review in weekly standup: "Any new closes? Kickoff done?" Document in Enterprise Operations Framework.

**When to escalate:** If the same person keeps missing the handoff: clarify capacity or reassign handoff to someone else. If the whole team is overloaded: see Team scaling section and [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md).

---

### Issue 6: Client has multiple stakeholders and feedback is conflicting

**Causes:** Multiple people on the client side (e.g. VP Marketing, Director, Manager); they give different direction; your team doesn't know who has final say.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Single point of contact (SPOC)** at kickoff. Account director asks: "Who has final approval on deliverables? Who do we send drafts to, and in what order?" Document (e.g. "Send to [Name]; they consolidate feedback from [Name] and [Name]; final sign-off from [Name]"). Put in CRM and kickoff summary.
2. **Consolidated feedback.** "Please consolidate feedback from your team and send us one set of edits." Don't accept "Person A said X, Person B said Y" without a decision from the SPOC. Account director: "Who can give us the final direction so we don't spin?"
3. **Going forward.** Send deliverables to the SPOC only (or to SPOC with cc to others for visibility). SPOC sends back one consolidated response. Document in Enterprise Operations Framework and in client welcome doc.
4. **If you're already in conflict:** Account director reaches out to SPOC. "We've received feedback from [A] and [B] that points different ways. Who can give us the final direction?" Get one person to own the decision. Document for future deliverables.

**Prevention:** SPOC identified at kickoff for every client. Documented in CRM and kickoff summary. Deliverables sent to SPOC; consolidated feedback only. Add to Enterprise Templates kickoff agenda.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to name a SPOC or the SPOC won't decide: Owner joins a call. "We need one decision-maker for feedback so we can deliver on time. Can we agree on that?" If they can't: consider whether the account is manageable; you may need to limit to one stakeholder or walk away.

---

## Team Scaling and Capacity

### Issue 1: Team is chronically overloaded and deadlines keep slipping

**Causes:** Too many clients for current team size; no capacity planning; new clients added without checking capacity. See [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) and [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md).

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Calculate capacity.** Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) Part 1: how many clients can each Delivery lead and Specialist run well? List every client and assign "owner" and hours or slot. If you're over capacity, you're overloaded.
2. **Short-term:** Prioritize. Which clients have the nearest deadlines or highest risk? Focus the team on those. Account director communicates to other clients: "We're shifting [deliverable] to [new date] to ensure quality. We'll have it to you by [date]." Don't over-promise.
3. **Medium-term:** Stop taking new clients until you deliver current work on time, or add capacity (hire, contractor). Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) and [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) for when to hire. Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) Part 2 (triggers).
4. **Capacity check before close.** Owner or Account director: "Do we have capacity for this client? If not, when will we?" Don't close if you don't have capacity unless you have a plan (e.g. start date in 4 weeks when a slot opens). Document in Enterprise Operations Framework.

**Prevention:** Capacity per role in Team Scaling Guide. Weekly standup: "How many clients per person? Any at capacity?" Capacity check before closing new deals. Review Scaling & Revenue Strategy when you hit 80%+ capacity.

**When to escalate:** If the team is chronically overloaded: Owner must decide—hire, reduce client count, or reduce scope per client. Don't let delivery quality and team burnout become the norm.

---

### Issue 2: You hired too early and can't afford the new role

**Causes:** Hired before revenue supported the cost; didn't check [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) cash flow; pipeline didn't convert.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Short-term cash flow.** Review Enterprise Budget Planning: revenue, expenses, team cost, cash reserve. If you're negative or low: (a) accelerate collections (follow up on overdue invoices); (b) reduce non-essential spend; (c) Owner draw or salary reduction temporarily if possible; (d) line of credit or bridge if you have it. Don't miss payroll.
2. **Role.** If the new hire is a contractor: reduce hours or end contract when the term allows. If full-time: consider whether you can reassign to revenue-generating work (e.g. sales support, delivery) so they earn their keep. If not, you may need to let them go; follow legal and ethical process (notice, severance if applicable).
3. **Going forward.** Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) Part 2 (triggers): only hire when revenue has hit the trigger for 2+ months and pipeline supports it. Use Enterprise Budget Planning to model "if we add this role, what revenue do we need?" before hiring. Owner approves all hires.
4. **Document.** Note what went wrong (revenue trigger, pipeline, cash flow). Update Team Scaling Guide triggers so you don't hire too early again.

**Prevention:** Hiring trigger in Team Scaling Guide (revenue + capacity). Enterprise Budget Planning updated before hire (can we afford this?). Owner approves hire. Pipeline and revenue reviewed before offer.

**When to escalate:** If you can't make payroll or you're in breach of contract: Owner and (if needed) legal/accountant must act immediately. Consider financing, cost cuts, or restructuring.

---

### Issue 3: New hire is underperforming and delivery is suffering

**Causes:** Unclear expectations; poor onboarding; role doesn't fit skills; no feedback loop.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Expectations.** Document role (from [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) Part 3): responsibilities, capacity (clients or hours), and success criteria. Share with the hire. "We need you to own [X] clients; deliverables on time; response time [Y]. Let's review in 30 days."
2. **Onboarding.** Ensure they have: access to tools, client roster, Enterprise Operations Framework (governance, SLAs), and a buddy or manager for questions. First 2 weeks: shadow; next 2 weeks: own 1 client with review. Check in at 30 days: what's working, what's not?
3. **Feedback.** If they're underperforming: specific feedback (e.g. "We've missed the deadline on Client A twice. What's getting in the way?"). Offer support (training, clearer briefs, reduced load). Set a 60–90 day improvement plan. Document.
4. **If no improvement.** After 60–90 days, if performance hasn't improved: consider role change (different clients, different responsibilities) or exit. Follow legal and ethical process. Use [Enterprise Operations Issues](agency-level-3-enterprise-operations-issues.md) (team scaling) for capacity backfill.

**Prevention:** Clear role definition and onboarding for every hire. 30-day and 60-day check-ins. Feedback and improvement plan if underperforming. Document expectations and feedback.

**When to escalate:** If the hire is causing client churn or team conflict: Owner or Delivery director must address immediately. Don't let one person drag down delivery or morale.

---

### Issue 4: Revenue-per-head is falling and margin is shrinking

**Causes:** Revenue didn't grow as fast as team; you added cost without proportional revenue; pricing or scope is wrong.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Calculate revenue-per-head.** Revenue ÷ FTE (or headcount). Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) Part 3 and [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF). Compare to target (e.g. $4k–$5k per person per month). If it's falling, you're adding cost faster than revenue.
2. **Short-term.** Stop hiring until revenue-per-head recovers. Focus on: (a) filling capacity (more clients per person if you have pipeline); (b) raising prices at renewal (see Enterprise positioning section); (c) reducing low-margin work or clients. Use Scaling & Revenue Strategy for pricing and margin by tier.
3. **Medium-term.** Ensure every new hire is tied to a revenue trigger (Team Scaling Guide Part 2). Model: "If we add this role at $X, we need $Y more revenue to maintain margin." Only hire when pipeline supports $Y.
4. **Review monthly.** Revenue-per-head and margin in monthly review (Level 3 Implementation Plan Phase 4). If trend is down for 2 months, act: pricing, capacity, or cost.

**Prevention:** Revenue-per-head and margin in Scaling & Revenue Strategy and Enterprise Budget Planning. Monthly review. Hiring trigger includes revenue support. Owner approves hire and reviews margin.

**When to escalate:** If revenue-per-head is below target for 3+ months: Owner leads a review. Consider pricing increase, capacity utilization, or cost reduction (role change, contractor vs full-time).

---

### Issue 5: Key person dependency—one person holds too much client or delivery knowledge

**Causes:** No documentation; one person owns key clients or critical process; bus factor is 1.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Document.** Key person documents: client context (goals, preferences, history), process (how delivery runs for their clients), and contacts (who at client, who on our team). Use [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) and client folder or CRM. Aim for "someone else could take over in 1 week."
2. **Shadow and backup.** Another person (Delivery lead or Account manager) shadows key person on 1–2 key clients. They run one deliverable or one call with key person as backup. Builds backup and reduces dependency.
3. **Cross-train.** If one person is the only one who can do [X] (e.g. RFP response, strategy doc), train a second person. Document the process in Enterprise Templates or internal playbook. Key person reviews and approves until backup is confident.
4. **If key person leaves.** Use the doc and backup to transition. Account director or Owner owns transition: intro new person to client, handoff doc, first 2 weeks overlap if possible. Don't let one departure crater delivery.

**Prevention:** Key clients and key processes documented. Backup identified and shadowed. Cross-training for critical skills. Review annually: who is key person dependency? Reduce it.

**When to escalate:** If key person is leaving and there's no backup: Owner prioritizes transition. May need to delay other work or bring in contractor to support transition. Communicate to clients early and professionally.

---

### Issue 6: You need to hire but can't find the right person

**Causes:** Niche role; salary below market; slow hiring process; unclear role.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Clarify role.** Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) Part 3: responsibilities, capacity, cost range, revenue this role must support. Write a clear job description. Share with network and post on relevant channels (LinkedIn, niche job boards, referral).
2. **Compensation.** Research market rate for the role and geography. If you're below market: consider raising (use [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) to see if you can afford it); or offer other value (remote, flexibility, equity if applicable). Don't underpay and expect top talent.
3. **Speed.** Move fast: screen → interview → offer within 2–3 weeks if possible. Good candidates don't wait. Assign one person (Owner or Delivery director) to own hiring for this role.
4. **Contractor option.** If you can't find full-time: use a contractor for 3–6 months. Document scope and deliverables. Use the time to validate the need and find full-time later. Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) Part 4 (contractor vs full-time).

**Prevention:** Clear role and job description. Competitive compensation. Fast process. Contractor as bridge if needed. Owner or designated person owns hiring.

**When to escalate:** If you've been hiring for 3+ months with no fit: consider whether the role is right (split into two roles? different skills?). Or consider external recruiter if budget allows.

---

## Partnerships and Strategic Deals

### Issue 1: Partner refers bad-fit leads and you waste time

**Causes:** No clear definition of ideal client shared with partner; partner refers anyone who asks.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Define ideal client** for the partner. Use [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) ideal client per line. Give partner a one-pager: "We're looking for [title] at [company size] who [need]. Budget range $X–$Y. We're not a fit for [out of scope]." Use [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md) positioning.
2. **Qualify.** When partner refers a lead: quick qualify (title, company size, budget, need). If bad-fit: "Thanks for the intro. This isn't quite our fit because [reason]. Here's what we're looking for: [one-pager]. Happy to take the next one that fits." Don't waste time on bad-fit leads; it also trains the partner.
3. **Feedback.** Tell partner (politely) when a lead wasn't a fit: "We spoke with [Name]; they're looking for [X] which we don't do. Our ideal is [Y]. If you have someone like that, we'd love the intro." Partner improves over time.
4. **Document.** Add "ideal client for partners" to [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md) and to partner one-pager. Share in partner onboarding.

**Prevention:** Partner one-pager with ideal client. Qualify every referral. Feedback to partner when lead isn't a fit. Document in Partnership Strategies.

**When to escalate:** If a partner keeps sending bad-fit leads after feedback: consider whether to continue the partnership or reduce touchpoints. Owner decides.

### Issue 2: Partner wants more referral fee or revenue share than you can afford

**Causes:** Partner negotiated hard; you didn't set a margin-based cap; now payouts are eating margin.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Cap.** Set a maximum referral fee (e.g. 20% of first contract) or revenue share (e.g. 10% for 12 months). Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) margin target. Don't agree to more than you can afford. Document in partner agreement.
2. **If partner already has a higher deal:** Renegotiate at renewal. "We're standardizing our partner terms. New referral fee is X% (or revenue share Y%). Your current deal is grandfathered until [date]; after that we'll use the new terms." Get it in writing. If they refuse, decide whether to keep the partnership (and absorb cost) or end it.
3. **New partners.** All new partners get the capped terms. No exceptions without Owner approval. Document in [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) partnership outline template.
4. **Track.** Use [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md) tracking: payouts per partner, revenue per partner. If a partner's payout is >20% of revenue they generated, flag it. Owner reviews.

**Prevention:** Referral fee and revenue share cap in Scaling & Revenue Strategy and partner agreement. All new partners get cap. Payouts tracked monthly. Owner approves any exception.

**When to escalate:** If partner demands more than cap and threatens to stop referring: Owner decides. Options: hold the line, one-time exception with end date, or end partnership. Don't let one partner dictate margin.

### Issue 3: Partner-sourced deal goes wrong and partner is upset

**Causes:** Delivery failed; client churned; partner feels their reputation is damaged.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Acknowledge.** Account director or Owner reaches out to partner. "We're sorry [Client] didn't work out. We take responsibility for [what went wrong]. Here's what we're doing to prevent it: [brief action]. We value the partnership and want to make it right."
2. **Make it right.** Options: (a) don't charge referral fee if client churned early (if in your agreement); (b) offer to refer a lead back to the partner if you have one; (c) offer a one-time discount on next referral fee if they send another lead. Don't over-promise; do something tangible.
3. **Fix delivery.** Do a post-mortem: why did the client churn? Fix the cause (scope, quality, communication). So the next partner-sourced client doesn't fail. Use [Enterprise Operations Issues](agency-level-3-enterprise-operations-issues.md) (multi-service delivery section).
4. **Document.** Note what went wrong and what you did. Share with team so you don't repeat. Update partner relationship (more touchpoints, clearer scope) if needed.

**Prevention:** Deliver well on every partner-sourced client. Partner agreement includes what happens if client churns (e.g. no fee if churn in first 90 days). Communicate with partner if issues arise; don't let them hear from the client first.

**When to escalate:** If the partner is threatening to end the partnership or bad-mouth you: Owner joins the conversation. Apologize, make it right, and document. If the relationship is salvageable, invest in it; if not, end professionally.

---

### Issue 4: You don't know which partners are sending revenue

**Causes:** No CRM tagging; no report; payouts are manual and inconsistent.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Tag.** In [GoHighLevel Enterprise](gohighlevel-enterprise-setup.md) or equivalent: tag every lead and deal with "Partner: [Name]" (and "Partner type: Referral" or "Reseller"). Use custom field or tag. When the deal closes, you can report revenue by partner.
2. **Report.** Monthly: list partners, leads referred, proposals sent, closed won, revenue. Use [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md) tracking. Share with Owner or Partnerships lead. Double down on top partners; fix or end underperformers.
3. **Payouts.** Track referral fee or revenue share due per partner. Pay on time (e.g. within 30 days of close or month-end). Document in partner agreement. Use Enterprise Budget Planning for cash flow.
4. **Governance.** One person (Owner or Partnerships lead) owns: partner recruitment, agreements, tagging, report, payouts. Document in Partnership Strategies.

**Prevention:** CRM tagging mandatory for every partner-sourced lead and deal. Monthly report. Payouts tracked and paid on time. One owner for partnerships. Document in Partnership Strategies.

**When to escalate:** If no one owns partnerships and tracking is a mess: Owner assigns one person (or takes it) and cleans up. Implement tagging and report within 30 days.

### Issue 5: Strategic partner wants exclusivity or non-compete and you're not sure

**Causes:** Partner wants exclusive referral rights in a vertical or geography; or non-compete (you won't work with their competitors). Legal and business risk.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Understand.** What exactly do they want? Exclusive in what (vertical, geography, channel)? Non-compete with whom (list of competitors)? For how long? Get it in writing (term sheet or draft agreement).
2. **Evaluate.** Can you live with it? If exclusive in one vertical and you're not focused there anyway, maybe yes. If non-compete with 20 agencies and you'd lose half your pipeline, no. Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) and pipeline mix to assess.
3. **Negotiate.** Push back: "We can do exclusive in [narrow scope] for [term]. We can't do exclusive in [broad scope]." Or "We can't sign a non-compete with [list]; we can agree not to poach each other's clients." Get legal review before signing.
4. **Document.** Any exclusivity or non-compete in partner agreement. Owner and (if needed) lawyer approve. Don't sign under pressure.

**Prevention:** Don't agree to exclusivity or non-compete without Owner and legal review. Document in partner agreement. Evaluate impact on pipeline and revenue before signing.

**When to escalate:** If the partner insists and you're not sure: Owner and lawyer must review. Don't sign until you understand the full impact.

### Issue 6: Partnership revenue is growing but you're not sure how to scale the channel

**Causes:** A few partners send most of the revenue; you don't have a plan to add more partners or deepen top partners.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Double down on top partners.** Identify top 3–5 partners by revenue. Increase touchpoints: monthly call, quarterly review, invite to event or co-marketing. Ask: "What would help you refer more? More case studies? One-pager? Intro to our team?" Use [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md) and [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md).
2. **Recruit more partners.** Use the same profile as your top partners (type, industry, buyer). Outreach 5–10 new partner candidates per quarter. Use partnership positioning (Example positioning statement 2 in Enterprise Outreach Guide). Track in CRM.
3. **Scale process.** Document: partner onboarding (one-pager, agreement, intro to team), tracking (tagging, report), payouts (when, how). So when you add partners, you're not reinventing. Use Partnership Strategies and Enterprise Templates partnership outline.
4. **Review quarterly.** Partnership revenue as % of total; number of active partners; revenue per partner. Goal: grow partnership revenue and number of partners without diluting quality. Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) for revenue by channel.

**Prevention:** Quarterly partnership review. Top partners get more touchpoints. New partner recruitment target (e.g. 2–3 new partners per quarter). Process documented in Partnership Strategies.

**When to escalate:** If partnership revenue is 20%+ and you want it to grow: consider dedicated Partnerships lead (see [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md)). Owner decides.

## Finance and Legal

### Issue 1: Client pays late or disputes invoice and you need cash flow

**Causes:** No clear payment terms in contract; invoice sent late or with errors; client doesn't know who to pay or when. Cash flow is tight.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Payment terms** in every contract and SOW (e.g. net 15, 50% upfront / 50% on delivery). Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) SOW template. Send first invoice with contract or within 24 hours of signed contract.
2. **If client pays late:** Polite reminder at day 15 (or per terms). "Friendly reminder: invoice [number] was due on [date]. Please pay at your earliest convenience." At day 30: Account director or Owner reaches out. "We need to resolve this so we can continue delivery. Can you confirm when we can expect payment?" Consider pausing delivery if payment is 60+ days overdue (per contract).
3. **If client disputes:** Get in writing what they think is wrong (wrong amount, wrong scope, already paid). Fix errors (re-issue invoice, correct amount) and resend. If they dispute scope: "This is per our SOW [section]. If you'd like to change scope, we can do an amendment." Don't keep delivering without payment unless you have a written payment plan.
4. **Cash flow.** Use [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) for cash flow. If you're tight: accelerate collections, reduce non-essential spend, or use line of credit. Owner owns cash flow.

**Prevention:** Payment terms in every contract. Invoice on time with clear line items. Reminder at 15 days; escalation at 30 days. One person owns billing. Enterprise Budget Planning updated monthly for cash flow.

**When to escalate:** If client refuses to pay or disputes in bad faith: Owner decides. May need formal demand, pause delivery, or legal. Don't let unpaid invoices run 90+ days without a decision.

---

### Issue 2: Contract or SOW is vague and client pushes back at renewal

**Causes:** Contract didn't specify term length, auto-renewal, termination, or scope; client thinks they can cancel anytime or renegotiate everything.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **New contracts.** Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) multi-service SOW template. Include: term (e.g. 6 months, 12 months), auto-renewal (e.g. "renews for same term unless either party gives 30 days notice"), termination (e.g. 30 days notice, or for cause), payment terms, scope by line. Have a lawyer review once.
2. **If client pushes back at renewal:** "Our standard terms are [X]. We're happy to discuss a one-time change if there's a specific concern." Get any change in writing (amendment or new contract). Don't agree to vague "we want more flexibility" without defining it.
3. **If current contract is vague:** At renewal, send new SOW or contract with clear terms. "We've updated our agreement to include [term length], [renewal], [termination], and [scope]. Please sign by [date] so we can continue." Use this as the chance to fix vagueness.
4. **Document.** All contract terms in a one-pager (internal) so the team knows what's standard. Use [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) for governance (who signs).

**Prevention:** Every new client gets SOW/contract with clear term, renewal, termination, payment, scope. Template reviewed by lawyer. At renewal, use same template. Owner or legal approves exceptions.

**When to escalate:** If client demands terms you're not willing to give (e.g. cancel anytime with no notice): Owner decides. "We can't do that; our standard is [X]. We're happy to find a middle ground if you have a specific need." Be willing to walk away.

---

### Issue 3: You're not sure about liability, insurance, or IP and a client is asking

**Causes:** No standard position on liability cap, insurance, or IP ownership; client's legal is pushing for terms you haven't reviewed.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Liability.** Many agencies cap liability at the fees paid under the contract (or 12 months of fees). Don't agree to unlimited liability without legal review. If client insists: "Our standard is [cap]. We can have our lawyer review your request and get back to you." Owner and lawyer decide.
2. **Insurance.** Many enterprise clients require proof of insurance (e.g. general liability, E&O). Get a quote from an insurer; maintain at least the minimum your clients typically require. Document in a one-pager so you can send proof quickly.
3. **IP (work product).** Standard: client owns work product once paid. You retain pre-existing IP and methods. Don't agree to "client owns everything including your methods" without legal review. Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) SOW template and have lawyer add IP clause.
4. **Document.** Standard positions on liability, insurance, and IP in internal one-pager or SOW template. Owner and lawyer approve. Don't deviate without approval.

**Prevention:** Standard liability, insurance, and IP positions documented. Lawyer reviewed once. SOW template includes (or references) these. Owner and lawyer approve any deviation.

**When to escalate:** Any time client's legal pushes for terms you haven't seen: pause and get lawyer review. Don't sign under pressure.

### Issue 4: Tax or compliance question (e.g. contractor vs employee, sales tax)

**Causes:** You're not sure if a hire should be contractor or employee; or whether you need to collect sales tax in a state.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Contractor vs employee.** Rules vary by jurisdiction. Generally: contractor has control over how they work; you don't withhold tax; you issue 1099 (US). Employee: you control when and how; you withhold tax; you provide benefits (if applicable). When in doubt, get an accountant or lawyer. Misclassification can lead to penalties. Use [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md) Part 4 for when you use contractors; ensure contracts are clear (scope, not employment).
2. **Sales tax.** Depends on state and whether your service is taxable. Many professional services are not taxable in many states; but rules vary. Get an accountant or sales tax specialist. Don't guess; wrong answer can mean back taxes and interest.
3. **Document.** Once you have an answer (contractor vs employee, sales tax), document it so you're consistent. Review annually or when you expand to new state/country.
4. **Don't give legal or tax advice to clients.** If a client asks you about their tax or legal, refer them to their advisor. You're not their lawyer or accountant.

**Prevention:** Accountant and lawyer on retainer or available for one-off questions. Document standard positions (contractor vs employee, sales tax). Review when you hire or expand.

**When to escalate:** Any time you're unsure: ask accountant or lawyer. Don't sign a contract or make a hire without clarity on classification or tax.

---

### Issue 5: Client threatens legal action or breach and you're not sure what to do

**Causes:** Dispute over scope, payment, or delivery; client threatens to sue or claims you're in breach.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Don't panic.** Acknowledge in writing: "We've received your message. We take this seriously and will respond by [date]." Buy time to get legal advice.
2. **Gather facts.** What does the contract say (scope, payment, termination)? What did you deliver? What did they pay? What are they claiming? Document timeline and evidence (emails, deliverables, invoices).
3. **Legal.** Get a lawyer (if you don't have one, find one who does commercial/contract disputes). Share contract, timeline, and claim. Get advice: are you in breach? What are your options (settle, negotiate, defend)? Don't respond to the client with legal arguments until lawyer approves.
4. **Respond.** With lawyer's approval, respond to the client. Often: "We believe we've performed per our contract. Here's what we've delivered [summary]. We're open to a conversation to resolve this. Please let us know if you'd like to schedule a call." Keep it professional and factual. Don't admit fault or promise anything without lawyer approval.
5. **Document.** All communication and decisions. If it escalates (formal demand, lawsuit), lawyer leads. Owner stays involved but doesn't make legal decisions alone.

**Prevention:** Clear contracts and SOWs (see Issue 2). Deliver per contract; document scope and changes. If client is unhappy, address early (see multi-service delivery section). Have a lawyer available before you need one.

**When to escalate:** Any threat of legal action: get a lawyer immediately. Don't respond to legal claims without lawyer review.

---

### Issue 6: You need to offboard a client and you're not sure how

**Causes:** Contract is ending; client is churning; or you're ending the relationship. You need a clean offboard without legal or reputational risk.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Notice.** Check the contract for termination notice (e.g. 30 days). Give written notice (email or letter) per the contract. "Per our agreement, we're providing [30] days notice to terminate our engagement effective [date]. We'll complete all deliverables in progress by [date] and will provide a handoff summary."
2. **Handoff.** Use [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) Part 4 (offboarding). Deliverables: handoff doc (what was delivered, what's in progress, where files are), final deliverable if any, final invoice. Get sign-off (email) that they've received the handoff and that you've met your obligations.
3. **Final payment.** Send final invoice. If they owe you money, follow up per payment terms. If you owe them a refund (per contract), process it. Don't leave money or obligations dangling.
4. **Internal.** Close the client in CRM; archive tasks and files. Remove from active client roster. Note reason for offboard (churn, mutual, you ended) for [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) and retention review.
5. **Professional.** Thank them for the engagement. Don't bad-mouth or burn bridges. You may work with them again or get a referral. Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) or a short offboard email template.

**Prevention:** Offboarding process in Enterprise Operations Framework Part 4. Every offboard: notice per contract, handoff doc, final invoice, sign-off. Owner approves offboarding (and any settlement). Document in internal playbook.

**When to escalate:** If the client is hostile or threatens legal: Owner and lawyer handle. Don't skip notice or handoff; document everything. If they refuse to sign off: send handoff anyway and note "delivered on [date]; awaiting confirmation." Protect yourself.
