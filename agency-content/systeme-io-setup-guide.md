# Systeme.io Setup Guide

Step-by-step setup for Systeme.io so you can run CRM, funnels, email, calendar, and contracts in one platform—supporting $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency.

## Overview

**Option A (All-in-One).** Systeme.io gives you one platform for CRM, pipelines, funnels, email, calendar, and contracts so a solo operator can run like a small team. For Level 1 solo agency ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), choosing Option A means fewer tools to learn and one login for sales and delivery. This guide walks you through account and plan selection, pipeline/CRM setup, funnel builder basics, email/automation, calendar and booking, and contracts/invoicing.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option A (All-in-One)**. If you prefer **Option B (Best-of-Breed)** with HubSpot free, ClickUp free, and Hello Bonsai, use those guides instead. Do not mix Option A and Option B for the same workflow; pick one path.

## Prerequisites

- Email address and payment method for Systeme.io plan
- [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) and [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) completed (to name pipelines and stages)
- Optional: [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) from the Templates section for alignment

**Time:** About 90–120 minutes total (account and pipeline ~25 min; funnel and email ~35 min; calendar and contracts ~30 min).

## Step 1: Account and Plan Selection

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a Systeme.io account and choose a plan that fits your client volume and needs.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [systeme.io](https://systeme.io) and sign up with your email (or use a social login if offered).
2. **Choose a plan:** Compare Free vs Startup vs Webinars vs Unlimited. For Level 1 solo agency (1–5 clients, $2k–$5k/month), Startup or Webinars tier often covers pipelines, funnels, email, and calendar. Check limits (contacts, emails, funnels) and upgrade when you outgrow them.
3. **Complete billing** if you select a paid plan. Ensure your account is active and you can access the dashboard.
4. **Verify:** You see the main dashboard with menu items for Funnels, Email, Contacts, Calendar, etc.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Systeme.io account created; [ ] Plan selected and active; [ ] Dashboard accessible

## Step 2: Pipeline / CRM Setup

**Time estimate:** 20–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a pipeline (deal stages) so you can track leads and clients from first contact to close and delivery.

### Sub-steps

1. In Systeme.io, go to **Contacts** or **CRM** (or equivalent; naming may vary by plan). Create or open your **sales pipeline** (e.g. "Agency pipeline").
2. **Define stages** that match your process. Example: Lead → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Closed won → Onboarded → Delivery → Renewal. Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) and [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) to keep stages simple (e.g. 5–7 stages).
3. **Add a test contact and deal:** Create one contact (e.g. "Test Lead") and move them through one stage so you understand the flow. Optionally add custom fields (company, budget, source) if your plan supports it.
4. **Document:** Note where you'll put new leads (e.g. from a form or manual add) and how you'll move deals when proposals are sent or contracts signed. Align with your [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) kickoff and discovery steps.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline created with clear stages; [ ] At least one test contact/deal added; [ ] You know how to add leads and move deals

## Step 3: Funnel Builder Basics

**Time estimate:** 25–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create at least one funnel (e.g. lead capture or booking) so you can capture leads or book calls without manual back-and-forth.

### Sub-steps

1. In Systeme.io, go to **Funnels** (or **Sites** / **Pages**). Create a new funnel or landing page.
2. **Choose a goal:** e.g. "Collect email" or "Book a call." Use a template if available (e.g. "Lead magnet" or "Consultation booking").
3. **Build the first page:** Add a headline, short value proposition (from your [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) and [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md)), and a form (name, email, company, or message). Or add a calendar embed for booking.
4. **Connect to your pipeline:** Set the form submission or booking to add a contact to your CRM and optionally set the deal stage (e.g. "Lead"). Add a tag if you use tags (e.g. "Website lead").
5. **Publish and test:** Publish the page, open it in a browser, and submit a test. Confirm the contact appears in your CRM and (if applicable) the deal stage or tag is set.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one funnel or landing page created; [ ] Form or booking connected to CRM; [ ] Test submission creates contact and (if applicable) deal

---

## Step 4: Email and Automation

**Time estimate:** 20–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up basic email sequences so you can nurture leads (e.g. welcome sequence, follow-up) without manual emails every time.

### Sub-steps

1. In Systeme.io, go to **Email** or **Automation**. Create an **email sequence** (e.g. "New lead welcome").
2. **Add 2–3 emails:** Welcome email (thank them, set expectation), follow-up (e.g. case study or offer), and optional third (e.g. "Still interested? Book a call"). Use your [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) messaging; keep tone professional and concise.
3. **Trigger:** Set the sequence to start when a contact is added (e.g. from your funnel form) or when they enter a tag. Optionally add a condition (e.g. only if tag = "Website lead").
4. **Optional automation:** If your plan supports automation workflows, add a simple flow (e.g. "When contact is added → Add tag → Start sequence"). Otherwise, manual tagging plus sequence is enough for Level 1.
5. **Test:** Add a test contact with your own email; confirm you receive the first email of the sequence.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one email sequence created; [ ] Trigger set (e.g. new contact or tag); [ ] Test email received

## Step 5: Calendar and Booking

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Let leads and clients book calls with you so you reduce back-and-forth and close faster.

### Sub-steps

1. In Systeme.io, go to **Calendar** or **Booking** (or use the built-in scheduler if available). Connect your calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, or Systeme.io native) so busy times are blocked.
2. **Create a booking type:** e.g. "Discovery call (30 min)" or "Strategy call (45 min)." Set duration, buffer between calls if needed, and availability (e.g. weekdays 9–5).
3. **Add the booking link** to your funnel, email signature, or website. Optionally add a short form before booking (name, email, company) so you have context.
4. **Test:** Book a test appointment with yourself. Confirm the event appears in your calendar and you receive a confirmation (if configured).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Calendar connected; [ ] At least one booking type created; [ ] Booking link works and events appear in calendar

## Step 6: Contracts and Invoicing

**Time estimate:** 15–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Use Systeme.io for contracts and invoicing so you can send proposals, contracts, and invoices from one place. (If you prefer to use Hello Bonsai for contracts only, you can use Systeme.io for CRM/funnels/email/calendar and Hello Bonsai for contracts—hybrid Option A/B.)

### Sub-steps

1. In Systeme.io, go to **Contracts** or **Invoicing** (if available on your plan). If not available, skip and use [Hello Bonsai Setup](hello-bonsai-setup.md) for contracts and invoices only.
2. **Contract template:** Create a simple service agreement template (scope, deliverables, payment terms, start/end date). Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) scope and [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) payment terms. Optionally get a lawyer to review once.
3. **Invoice template:** Set up an invoice template (your business name, client name, line items, amount, due date). Align with your payment terms (e.g. 50% upfront, 50% on delivery; or net 15).
4. **Client onboarding workflow:** When a deal moves to "Closed won," send the contract (e-sign) and first invoice. Document this in your [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) checklist so you repeat it for every new client.
5. **Test:** Send a test contract and invoice to yourself; confirm you can e-sign and (if applicable) pay or record payment.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Contract template created (or Hello Bonsai used for contracts); [ ] Invoice template created; [ ] You know how to send contract and invoice on close
