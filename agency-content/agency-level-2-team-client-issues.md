# Team & Client Operations Issues

Common issues and solutions for small team agency operations ($5,000–$15,000/month). For each issue: causes, step-by-step resolution, prevention, and when to escalate.

## Team Roles and Handoffs

### Issue 1: Unclear who owns the client or the task

**Causes:** No documented roles or handoffs; team assumes someone else will do it. Client gets mixed messages or work falls through the cracks.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Document roles and handoffs using the [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md). Part 1: who does what (Owner, Delivery lead, Account manager, Specialist). Part 2: who passes what to whom (lead→delivery, delivery→client, feedback→delivery, renewal).
2. Assign one **account owner** per client (typically Account manager). Assign one **delivery owner** per client (typically Delivery lead). Put it in your CRM or [ClickUp](clickup-paid-setup.md) so everyone can see.
3. In the next internal standup, confirm: "For Client A, [Name] is account owner, [Name] is delivery lead." Repeat for every client. Update [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) kickoff so new clients get an assigned owner at kickoff.
4. If work was dropped: apologize to the client, deliver the missing work, and document the handoff so it doesn't happen again.

**Prevention:** Use the Team Management Framework when you add team members or clients. Review "who owns what" in weekly standup. Add owner fields to your CRM and task tool so it's visible.

**When to escalate:** If the same person keeps dropping balls: clarify capacity (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) Part 4). If roles are still unclear after documentation: consider a short internal workshop to agree on handoffs and then document.

---

### Issue 2: Client talks to the wrong person or gets conflicting answers

**Causes:** Client has multiple points of contact; team members give different answers on scope, timeline, or price. No single "face" of the account.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Designate one **primary contact** per client (usually Account manager). Tell the client: "For strategy, check-ins, and questions, you'll work with [Name]. For day-to-day delivery, [Name] will coordinate." Put it in the kickoff agenda and welcome email.
2. Internal rule: only the account owner (or Owner) speaks for scope, timeline, and price. Delivery lead and Specialist route client questions to the account owner unless it's a simple delivery update (e.g. "Draft will be ready Tuesday").
3. If the client has already been talking to multiple people: send a short email. "Going forward, [Name] will be your main contact for [strategy/renewals/questions]. [Name] will handle delivery updates. This will keep things clear and fast."
4. Create a short internal FAQ (scope, revision policy, payment terms) so anyone who does answer gives the same answer. Use [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) as the source.

**Prevention:** Document primary contact in kickoff and in CRM. Train team: "If the client asks about scope or price, hand off to [account owner]." Review in standup if clients report confusion.

**When to escalate:** If the client insists on talking only to the Owner or a specific person: decide whether to allow it (e.g. for one key account) or gently redirect: " [Name] can answer that; I'll have them reach out today."

### Issue 3: Handoff from sales to delivery is messy (kickoff late or missing)

**Causes:** Deal closes but no one creates the kickoff, adds the client to the task tool, or sends the welcome. Client is left waiting; delivery doesn't know the scope.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Define the handoff in [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) Part 2: when deal moves to "Closed won," who creates the kickoff, who adds the client to [ClickUp](clickup-paid-setup.md) or [Zite](zite-setup-guide.md), who sends the welcome email. Assign one person (e.g. Account manager).
2. Add a **checklist** (use [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) handoff checklist): contract signed → welcome sent → kickoff scheduled → kickoff held → tasks created → first deliverable date set. Complete within 5 business days of signed contract.
3. If a client is already waiting: apologize, send the welcome and kickoff invite within 24 hours, and run the kickoff within 5 days. Backfill tasks and dates. Document the checklist so you don't skip steps next time.
4. Optional: in [GoHighLevel](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) or [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md), create a task or automation when deal moves to "Closed won" (e.g. "Create kickoff for [Client name]" assigned to Account manager).

**Prevention:** Make the handoff checklist mandatory for every new client. Review in standup: "Any new closes this week? Kickoff done?" Hold the account owner accountable for completing the checklist.

**When to escalate:** If the same person keeps missing the handoff: clarify capacity or reassign the handoff to someone else. If the whole team is overloaded: consider whether you're closing too many deals for current capacity (see [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md)).

---

### Issue 4: Renewal or upsell falls through the cracks

**Causes:** No one owns renewal; 45-day or 30-day check-in never happens; client churns or renews without a conversation about upsell.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Assign **renewal owner** (usually Account manager) in [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md). Define the process in [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) Part 3: 45 days out check-in, 30 days renewal offer, 14 days follow-up.
2. Add **renewal tasks** to your task tool or CRM: e.g. "Client A – 45-day renewal check-in" due 45 days before contract end. Assign to Account manager. Create the task when the contract is signed or set a recurring reminder.
3. If a client already churned or renewed without a conversation: note it for next time. For current clients, create 45-day and 30-day tasks for every contract end date. Use the [Renewal conversation guide](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) so the Account manager has a script.
4. Review pipeline or CRM monthly: list all contracts ending in the next 60 days. Confirm each has a renewal task and owner.

**Prevention:** Renewal task created at onboarding (due 45 days before end). Renewal owner and process documented in Client Retention Strategies. Monthly review of "contracts ending next 60 days."

**When to escalate:** If the Account manager is overloaded and renewals are slipping: Owner takes over renewal for 1–2 key accounts, or you hire/assign a dedicated success role. If clients churn because of delivery issues, fix delivery first (see Multi-client capacity and delivery).

---

### Issue 5: Team members don't know who is on which client

**Causes:** No shared view of "client → owner → delivery lead"; new hires or part-time people don't know where to look.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Create a **client roster** (simple table or tab in CRM): Client name, Account owner, Delivery lead, Contract end date, Tier. Update when you add a client or change ownership. Share in a pinned Slack channel, ClickUp doc, or CRM dashboard.
2. In [GoHighLevel](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) or [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md), use contact or company owner field and a "Delivery lead" custom field if available. In [ClickUp](clickup-paid-setup.md), use folder or list name (e.g. "Client A – [Account owner]") or a custom field.
3. Onboard new team members: "Here's the client roster. You're delivery lead for Client A and B; Account manager for C and D." Give them access to the roster and the Team Management Framework.
4. Review the roster in weekly standup: "Any changes to ownership or capacity?" Update the doc and CRM so it's always current.

**Prevention:** Client roster is a living doc; one person (e.g. Owner or Account manager) owns keeping it updated. New clients get added within 24 hours of kickoff. Roster is the single source of truth for "who is on which client."

**When to escalate:** If the roster is always wrong or no one uses it: make it the only place to check (e.g. "No client work until the roster says you're assigned"). Tie it to capacity (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) Part 4).

---

## Service Scope and Client Expectations

### Issue 1: Client expects more than the tier includes (scope creep)

**Causes:** Vague SOW or proposal; client assumes "everything" is included; no clear "out of scope" list; team said yes to one-off requests without updating scope or price.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Document scope and exclusions using [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md). In every proposal and contract, list deliverables by tier and add "Out of scope: [list]. Add-ons available: [list and price]."
2. When the client asks for something new: "That's outside our current scope. We can add it as an add-on for $X or as a one-off for $Y." Get agreement in writing (email or amendment) before doing the work. Account owner responds; Delivery lead doesn't promise scope without Account owner or Owner approval.
3. If you've already been doing extra work: schedule a short call (Account owner). "We've been doing [X] which wasn't in the original scope. Going forward we'd like to add it formally for $Z so we can keep delivering at this level." Be polite and firm.
4. At renewal, compare what you're delivering to what you're charging. If scope has grown, adjust price or add an add-on. Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md).

**Prevention:** Every new client: clear scope in proposal and contract. Use [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) kickoff agenda to confirm scope. One person (Account owner) owns scope conversations. Document "out of scope" and add-ons in Service Suite Development and in the contract.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to pay for added scope or threatens to leave: Owner decides whether to hold the line or make a one-time exception. If it becomes a pattern, consider ending the contract at renewal or adding a formal change-order process.

---

### Issue 2: Client thinks they get unlimited revisions or 24/7 support

**Causes:** Contract or proposal didn't specify revision limits or response time; client assumes "we're paying a lot" means unlimited access.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Define revision policy and response expectations in [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and in the contract. Example: "2 rounds of revisions per deliverable; additional rounds at $X per round." "We respond within 1 business day; urgent requests may require a separate agreement."
2. Add to the kickoff agenda: "Revisions: 2 rounds per deliverable. Response time: within 1 business day." Get verbal confirmation. Put it in the welcome email or a short "How we work" doc.
3. If the client is already demanding unlimited revisions or same-day responses: Account owner sends a short email. "Our standard is [X]. We've been flexible so far; going forward we'll follow [X] so we can keep quality high for everyone." Offer add-on for extra revisions or priority support if you have it.
4. Track revision rounds in your task tool (e.g. "Round 1 feedback," "Round 2 feedback") so you can show "we've done 2 rounds" if the client asks for more.

**Prevention:** Revision policy and response time in every contract and kickoff. Team knows: don't promise "unlimited" or "same-day" unless it's in the contract. Document in Agency Operations Templates.

**When to escalate:** If the client threatens to leave over revision limits: Owner decides whether to offer a one-time extra round or hold the line. If you consistently need more than 2 rounds, consider improving the first draft (e.g. better discovery, clearer brief) so revision demand drops.

---

### Issue 3: Client is unhappy with quality but won't specify what's wrong

**Causes:** Vague feedback ("it's not what we wanted"); no structured feedback process; client doesn't know how to give useful input.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Use a structured feedback format (e.g. [Zite](zite-setup-guide.md) or a short form): "What works? What needs to change? Specific edits (if any)." Add to your [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) or deliverable handoff. "Please reply with feedback by [date] using this format."
2. Account owner or Delivery lead schedules a 15-min call: "We want to make sure we nail the next deliverable. Can you walk us through what wasn't right and what good looks like for you?" Take notes; turn into a brief or checklist for the next round.
3. If the client still won't specify: "We need one or two specific examples (e.g. 'Section 2 felt off' or 'tone was too formal') so we can fix it. Can you point to one thing we can change for the next one?" Don't keep guessing; get at least one concrete example.
4. Document "client preferences" after the call (tone, format, do/don't) and share with the team. Use it for the next deliverable so quality improves.

**Prevention:** Every deliverable sent with a clear "Feedback by [date]" and a short feedback format. After any quality complaint, do a 15-min call to get specifics and document preferences. Add preferences to the client's folder or CRM note.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to give specifics and keeps saying "just make it better": Owner joins a call to set expectation. "We need specific feedback to improve. Without it, we're guessing." If they still won't engage, consider whether the relationship is salvageable; document everything for potential offboarding.

---

### Issue 4: Different stakeholders at the client give conflicting feedback

**Causes:** Multiple people on the client side (e.g. marketing lead and CEO); they give different direction; your team doesn't know who has final say.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. At kickoff, ask: "Who has final approval on deliverables? Who do we send drafts to, and in what order?" Document it (e.g. "Send to [Name]; they consolidate feedback from [Name] and [Name]; final sign-off from [Name]").
2. If you're already getting conflicting feedback: Account owner reaches out to the main contact. "We've received feedback from [A] and [B] that points different ways. Who can give us the final direction so we don't spin?" Get one person to own the consolidated feedback.
3. Going forward: send deliverables to the **single point of contact** (SPOC) you identified. "Please consolidate feedback from your team and send us one set of edits." Don't accept "Person A said X, Person B said Y" without a decision from the SPOC.
4. Add to future kickoffs: "Who is our single point of contact for feedback and approval?" Put it in the kickoff agenda and in the client's CRM note.

**Prevention:** Every client: identify SPOC for feedback and approval at kickoff. Document in CRM and in Agency Operations Templates. If the client has multiple stakeholders, make "consolidated feedback" the rule.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to name a SPOC or the SPOC won't decide: Owner joins a call. "We need one decision-maker for feedback so we can deliver on time. Can we agree on that?" If they can't, consider whether the account is manageable; you may need to limit to one stakeholder or walk away.

---

### Issue 5: Client says "that's not what we agreed" but you have no written record

**Causes:** Scope or timeline was agreed verbally or in a call; no email or contract amendment; client remembers differently.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Going forward: **every** scope or timeline change gets a short email confirmation. "Per our call: we're adding [X] for $Y, delivery by [date]. Please confirm." Or use a contract amendment for bigger changes. Account owner sends it; keep in client folder or CRM.
2. If the client says "that's not what we agreed" and you have no record: "We don't have a written record of that. Going forward we'll confirm any change in email so we're aligned. For this one, can we agree on [X] as the path forward?" Don't accuse; fix the process.
3. After every kickoff or scope call, send a "Summary of what we agreed" email (deliverables, dates, revision policy, contact). Use the [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) kickoff agenda as the source; attach or paste the summary.
4. Store all scope-related emails and amendments in one place (CRM, folder, or shared drive) so you can pull "what we agreed" when needed.

**Prevention:** No scope or timeline change without written confirmation (email or amendment). Kickoff summary email sent within 24 hours of kickoff. One person (Account owner) owns sending confirmations. Document in Team Management Framework and Agency Operations Templates.

**When to escalate:** If the client insists they agreed to something you have no record of and it's a big scope or price change: Owner decides. "We don't have that in our records. We can do [X] going forward if we add it to the contract for $Y." Don't give away scope without a written agreement.

## Multi-Client Capacity and Delivery

### Issue 1: Team is overloaded and deadlines are slipping

**Causes:** Too many clients for current team size; no capacity planning; new clients added without checking capacity. See [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) Part 4 (capacity).

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Calculate current capacity: how many clients can each Delivery lead and Specialist run well? Use the Team Management Framework Part 4 (e.g. "1 delivery lead = 3–4 clients"). List every client and assign hours or "slot." If you're over capacity, you're overloaded.
2. Short-term: prioritize. Which clients have the nearest deadlines or the highest risk? Focus the team on those. Communicate to other clients: "We're shifting [deliverable] to [new date] to ensure quality. We'll have it to you by [date]." Account owner sends the message; don't over-promise.
3. Medium-term: stop taking new clients until you deliver current work on time, or add capacity (hire, contractor, or reduce scope for some clients). Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) for when to scale team.
4. Add a **capacity check** before every new close: "Do we have a slot for this client? If not, when will we?" Owner or Delivery lead owns the check. Don't close if you don't have capacity unless you have a plan (e.g. start date in 4 weeks when a slot opens).

**Prevention:** Capacity per role documented in Team Management Framework. Weekly standup: "How many clients per person? Any at capacity?" Capacity check before closing new deals. Review [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) when you hit 80%+ capacity.

**When to escalate:** If the team is chronically overloaded: Owner must decide—hire, reduce client count, or reduce scope per client. Don't let delivery quality and team burnout become the norm.

---

### Issue 2: One client monopolizes time and others suffer

**Causes:** One client is high-touch, demanding, or in crisis; team spends disproportionate time on them; other clients get delayed or neglected.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Cap time or touch per client (from [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md)). Example: "Starter = X hours/month; Growth = Y; Premium = Z." Track roughly (e.g. in ClickUp or a simple timesheet). If one client is over their tier's allocation, flag it.
2. Account owner has a conversation with the high-touch client: "We want to give you the best results. To do that we need to balance your work with our other commitments. Here's what's in scope for your tier; if you need more, we can discuss an add-on or tier upgrade." Be polite and firm.
3. Internally: ring-fence time for other clients. "Client A gets M/W; Client B and C get T/Th." Or "No client gets more than X hours per week unless we've agreed an add-on." Delivery lead owns the allocation; Account owner owns the client conversation.
4. If the client refuses to stay in scope and won't pay for more: consider whether to (a) offer a one-time catch-up and then hold the line, (b) raise their tier/price at renewal, or (c) end the contract. Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) and Owner judgment.

**Prevention:** Rough time or touch allocation per tier (document in Service Suite Development). Weekly standup: "Any client over their allocation?" Account owner addresses overuse with the client before it becomes normal.

**When to escalate:** If one client is driving team burnout or others are churning because of neglect: Owner decides whether to re-scope, re-price, or offboard the high-touch client. Don't keep sacrificing the rest of the book for one account unless they're paying for it.

---

### Issue 3: Deliverables are late and clients are complaining

**Causes:** Unrealistic deadlines; no buffer; tasks not assigned or tracked; handoffs delayed.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Set **internal deadlines** earlier than client-facing dates (e.g. client sees "Friday"; internal deadline is "Wednesday" so you have buffer for revision or issues). Document in [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) playbooks and in ClickUp.
2. Assign every task to a person and a due date. No "someone will do it." Delivery lead owns assignment; standup reviews "what's due this week" and "any blockers."
3. If a deliverable is already late: Account owner tells the client immediately. "We're running behind on [deliverable]. New date: [date]. We're sorry for the delay." Then fix the process (why was it late? Underestimation? Overload? Missing handoff?) and document so it doesn't repeat.
4. Use the [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) handoff checklist so delivery→client handoffs don't sit in limbo. "Draft ready → Account owner/Delivery lead sends to client → feedback due [date]."

**Prevention:** Internal deadline = client deadline minus buffer. Every task has an owner and due date. Weekly standup reviews due dates and blockers. Late deliverable triggers a short post-mortem: what broke, how we fix it.

**When to escalate:** If lateness is chronic: Owner reviews capacity and process. You may need more buffer, fewer clients, or a dedicated project coordinator. If a client is at risk of churning due to lateness, Owner may join the account to stabilize.

---

### Issue 4: Quality is inconsistent across clients (one team member strong, others weak)

**Causes:** No shared standards or review process; some team members are newer or less experienced; no quality check before work goes to the client.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Define **quality standards** (e.g. "All client-facing copy is proofread; all deliverables match the brief"). Document in [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) or an internal playbook. "No deliverable goes to the client without [check]."
2. Add a **review step** where applicable: e.g. Delivery lead or Owner reviews before Account owner sends to client. Don't skip for "easy" clients; consistency matters.
3. If one team member's work is consistently weaker: pair them with a stronger person (review, feedback, templates). Invest in training or clearer briefs so they know what "good" looks like. Don't blame publicly; fix the system (briefs, checklist, review).
4. Collect client feedback (e.g. in status or review) on quality. "How did we do on [deliverable]?" Use it to improve briefs and standards. Share anonymized feedback in standup so the team learns.

**Prevention:** Quality standards and review step in Service Suite Development or playbook. Every deliverable goes through the same process (brief → draft → review → client). Training and templates for new or struggling team members.

**When to escalate:** If one person's work is repeatedly below standard and training hasn't helped: Owner addresses performance (expectations, support, or role change). If the whole team is inconsistent: invest in better briefs, templates, and a single "quality owner" (e.g. Delivery lead) who signs off before client send.

---

### Issue 5: New client onboarding is slow and first deliverable is delayed

**Causes:** Kickoff delayed; discovery or brief missing; tasks created late; client doesn't send inputs on time.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Use the [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) kickoff checklist and handoff. Contract signed → welcome within 24 hours → kickoff within 5 business days → tasks and first deliverable date set at kickoff. Account owner owns the timeline.
2. If the client is slow to send inputs (e.g. discovery form, brand assets): set a clear deadline in the welcome email. "We need your discovery form by [date] to schedule kickoff." Follow up once; if still no response, "We'll need to push kickoff to [date] once we have your input." Don't let the client delay indefinitely without resetting expectations.
3. Create tasks and first deliverable date **in the kickoff** or same day. Don't leave "we'll send the timeline later." "First deliverable: [date]. We'll send a draft by [date]; feedback by [date]." Put it in the kickoff summary email.
4. If you're already behind on a new client: run kickoff within 48 hours, send the summary and first deliverable date the same day, and stick to it. Apologize for the slow start and then deliver on the new timeline.

**Prevention:** Kickoff checklist mandatory; Account owner completes it within 5 business days of signed contract. Client input deadline in welcome email. First deliverable date set at kickoff and in summary email. Review in standup: "Any new clients? Kickoff done? First deliverable date set?"

**When to escalate:** If the client consistently delays input and it's hurting delivery: Account owner sets a firm rule. "We need [input] by [date] or we'll need to shift the first deliverable to [later date]." If the client still doesn't engage, Owner may need to decide whether to pause the engagement until they're ready.

---

## Billing, Contracts, and Renewals

### Issue 1: Client pays late or disputes an invoice

**Causes:** No clear payment terms in contract; invoice sent late or with errors; client doesn't know who to pay or when.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Confirm **payment terms** in the contract (e.g. net 15, 50% upfront / 50% on delivery). Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) and your contract template. Send the first invoice with the contract or within 24 hours of signed contract.
2. If the client pays late: send a polite reminder at day 15 (or per your terms). "Friendly reminder: invoice [number] was due on [date]. Please pay at your earliest convenience." If still unpaid at day 30: Account owner or Owner reaches out. "We need to resolve this so we can continue delivery. Can you confirm when we can expect payment?"
3. If the client **disputes** the invoice: get in writing what they think is wrong (wrong amount, wrong scope, already paid). Fix errors (re-issue invoice, correct amount) and resend. If they dispute scope: "This is per our contract [section]. If you'd like to change scope, we can do an amendment." Don't keep delivering without payment unless you have a written agreement (e.g. payment plan).
4. Going forward: invoice on time; include clear line items (retainer, add-on, date); one person (Owner or Account manager) owns billing. Document in [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) or internal process.

**Prevention:** Payment terms in every contract. Invoice sent on time with clear line items. Reminder at 15 days; escalation at 30 days. One person owns billing; document who and when.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to pay or disputes in bad faith: Owner decides whether to pause delivery, send a formal demand, or involve legal. Don't let unpaid invoices run for more than 60 days without a decision.

---

### Issue 2: Contract is vague and client pushes back on terms at renewal

**Causes:** Contract didn't specify term length, auto-renewal, or termination; client thinks they can cancel anytime or renegotiate everything at renewal.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. For **new** contracts: use a clear contract (from your template or lawyer). Include: term (e.g. 3 months, 6 months, 12 months), auto-renewal (e.g. "renews for same term unless either party gives 30 days notice"), termination (e.g. 30 days notice, or for cause), payment terms, and scope. Have a lawyer review once if you haven't.
2. If the client is **pushing back** at renewal: "Our standard terms are [X]. We're happy to discuss a one-time change if there's a specific concern." Don't agree to vague "we want more flexibility" without defining it. Get any change in writing (amendment or new contract).
3. If the current contract is vague: at renewal, send a new contract with clear terms. "We've updated our agreement to include [term length], [renewal], and [termination]. Please sign by [date] so we can continue." Use this as the chance to fix the vagueness.
4. Document all contract terms in a one-pager (for internal use) so the team knows what's standard. Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) for pricing and term; contract template for legal terms.

**Prevention:** Every new client gets a contract with clear term, renewal, termination, and payment terms. Contract template reviewed by a lawyer. At renewal, use the same template; don't roll over a vague contract forever.

**When to escalate:** If the client demands terms you're not willing to give (e.g. cancel anytime with no notice, or unlimited revisions): Owner decides. "We can't do that; our standard is [X]. We're happy to find a middle ground if you have a specific need." Be willing to walk away if the terms are bad for the business.

---

### Issue 3: Client churns and you didn't see it coming

**Causes:** No health signals or check-ins; client was unhappy but didn't say; renewal conversation happened too late.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Use [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) Part 1 (health signals) and Part 2 (touchpoints). Train the team: slow feedback, missed calls, vague "we need to talk" = warning. Account owner should schedule a check-in within 48 hours when a warning appears.
2. If the client already churned: conduct a short **exit conversation** (if they're willing). "We're sorry to see you go. Would you share what we could have done better?" Use the feedback to improve (scope, quality, communication). Don't argue; listen and document.
3. Add **renewal conversation** at 45 days before contract end (Client Retention Strategies Part 3). "How are we doing? What's next for you?" If they're unhappy, you have 45 days to fix it or to prepare for churn. If they're happy, send the renewal offer.
4. Review churn monthly: how many clients left, why (if known). Look for patterns (e.g. one tier churns more, or one service line). Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) to adjust.

**Prevention:** Health signals and touchpoints documented and used. Renewal conversation at 45 days. Account owner owns "client health" and renewal. Monthly churn review.

**When to escalate:** If churn is high (e.g. >20% per year) or you keep losing clients for the same reason: Owner leads a review. Fix delivery, scope, or pricing; consider whether you're targeting the right clients or need to change the offer.

---

### Issue 4: Client wants to renegotiate price or scope mid-contract

**Causes:** Client budget cut; client thinks they're overpaying; scope has grown and they want to pay less, or scope has shrunk and they want a discount.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. **Scope grew:** "We've been doing [X] which is beyond the original scope. We have two options: (a) add it to the contract for $Y, or (b) revert to the original scope. Which do you prefer?" Get it in writing. Don't keep delivering more for the same price without an amendment.
2. **Client wants a discount mid-contract:** "Our contract is [X] through [end date]. We're not able to change price mid-term unless we also change scope. At renewal we can discuss a different tier or price." If they're in hardship, Owner may offer a one-time discount (e.g. 10% for one month) in exchange for a testimonial or extended term—get it in writing.
3. **Scope shrunk (client wants to do less):** "We can reduce scope to [X] and adjust the price to $Y starting [date]. We'll send an amendment." Don't keep charging full price for reduced scope; it leads to resentment. Use [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) tiers to offer a lower tier or custom scope.
4. Document every change in an email or contract amendment. Account owner or Owner owns the conversation; don't let the client push the team into verbal agreements.

**Prevention:** Mid-contract changes require written agreement (email or amendment). Scope increase = price increase or add-on. Scope decrease = price decrease or tier change. One person (Owner or Account owner) owns renegotiation.

**When to escalate:** If the client demands a big discount or scope change and won't sign an amendment: Owner decides. "We need to document any change. If we can't agree, we'll continue under the current contract until renewal, when we can part ways if needed."

### Issue 5: You don't know when contracts end or who to follow up with

**Causes:** No central list of contract end dates; renewal owner unclear; no reminder system.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Create a **contract calendar** (list or CRM view): Client name, Contract end date, Renewal owner. Update when you sign a new contract or amendment. Review monthly in pipeline or team meeting.
2. Set **renewal reminders**: 45 days and 30 days before each contract end. Use your task tool (ClickUp) or CRM (GoHighLevel, HubSpot) to create tasks: "Client A – 45-day renewal check-in" due 45 days before end. Assign to Account manager.
3. If you're already past 45 days for some clients: create the tasks now for the next 60 days. For clients whose contract ended without a renewal conversation, note it and fix the process for the rest.
4. One person (e.g. Account manager or Owner) owns keeping the contract calendar current and ensuring renewal tasks exist. Document in [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) and [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md).

**Prevention:** Contract end date in CRM or contract calendar. Renewal task created at onboarding (due 45 days before end). Monthly review: "Contracts ending in next 60 days—renewal task and owner confirmed?" Renewal owner and process in Client Retention Strategies.

**When to escalate:** If no one owns the contract calendar and renewals keep slipping: Owner assigns one person and holds them accountable. If you have too many clients to track manually, use CRM automation (e.g. "Create renewal task when contract end date is 45 days out").
