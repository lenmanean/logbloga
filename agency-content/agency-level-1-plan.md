# Solo Agency / Freelance+ — Implementation Plan

Step-by-step roadmap for running a one-person agency and reaching $2,000–$5,000/month.

## Overview

This implementation plan guides you through building a solo agency with a clear niche, service packages, target client, and first clients—within 3–4 weeks and $100–300/month platform costs. The Agency package is the most expensive in the product lineup; quality of execution here directly impacts your revenue. Whether you use AI for proposal drafts, positioning copy, ad creative, and SEO briefs or work through each step manually, this plan gives you an actionable path to $2,000–$5,000/month as a one-person operation.

**Who this is for:** Solo operators or freelancers+ aiming for $2,000–$5,000/month as a one-person agency—with a defined niche, service packages, target client, first clients landed, and systems in place. AI leverage (ChatGPT, Claude, Canva AI, AI SEO e.g. Jasper, AI ad tools) lets you deliver at 2–3 person capacity alone.

**Expected outcome:** Niche chosen; service packages defined; target client clear; Option A (Systeme.io) or Option B (HubSpot free, ClickUp free, Hello Bonsai) in use; first 1–2 agency clients landed or in pipeline; Client Onboarding Template (ZIP) in use; Solo Revenue Strategy and Solo Budget Worksheet in use. Platform costs stay in the $100–300/month range for Level 1.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, decide how you'll run your stack:

- **Option A (All-in-One):** [Systeme.io](systeme-io-setup-guide.md) — one platform for CRM, funnels, email, calendar, and contracts. Fewer tools to learn; good if you want simplicity.
- **Option B (Best-of-Breed):** [HubSpot free](hubspot-free-setup.md) (CRM and marketing), [ClickUp free](clickup-free-setup.md) (tasks and delivery), [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) (contracts and invoicing). More flexibility; good if you already use or prefer these tools.

**Platform setup:** For step-by-step setup, use the Platform Setup Guides in this level: [Systeme.io Setup Guide](systeme-io-setup-guide.md) (Option A), [HubSpot Free Setup](hubspot-free-setup.md), [ClickUp Free Setup](clickup-free-setup.md), [Hello Bonsai Setup](hello-bonsai-setup.md) (Option B). Follow **one path**; all four guides are available so you can choose.

### Choosing Your Path

- **Pick Option A (Systeme.io)** if you want one login, one billing, and built-in CRM, funnels, email, calendar, and contracts. Best for speed and simplicity.
- **Pick Option B (HubSpot + ClickUp + Hello Bonsai)** if you want best-in-class free CRM (HubSpot), flexible project management (ClickUp), and professional contracts/invoicing (Hello Bonsai). Best if you value flexibility or already use one of these tools.

## Working with AI Tools

AI can act as a force multiplier for solo capacity—proposal drafts, positioning copy, ad creative ideas, and SEO briefs—so you reach $2,000–$5,000/month without burning out.

### For Non-Technical Users

**Effective communication with AI:**
- **Be specific:** Instead of "write a proposal," say "I run a [niche] agency. My packages are [brief scope]. Write a 1-page proposal structure with summary, scope, deliverables, and investment. Tone: professional."
- **Provide context:** Share your niche, target client, and service packages so AI matches your positioning.
- **Give feedback:** "Make it shorter" or "Add a section on timeline." Always personalize before sending.

**What to use AI for:**
- **Proposal drafts:** ChatGPT or Claude for structure and first draft; you fill in numbers and specifics.
- **Positioning copy:** "I help [target client] achieve [outcome] through [service]. Write a positioning statement and 3 proof points."
- **Ad creative ideas:** Canva AI or AI ad tools for concept visuals; you approve and brand.
- **SEO briefs:** "What keywords do [niche] clients search for? Give me 5 topics for blog or content."

**When to do it yourself:** Client relationships, strategy decisions, pricing, and final approval. AI drafts; you own the relationship and the close.

### For All Users

**Use AI for:** Proposal drafts, positioning and website copy, ad creative concepts, SEO or content briefs. Always review and personalize AI output before sending to clients.

**Do yourself:** Niche choice, service package design, pricing, client conversations, and final deliverables. Keep strategy and relationships human.

## Step-by-Step Roadmap

### Phase 1: Niche and Service Packages (Days 1–7)

#### Step 1.1: Complete the Agency Niche Framework

**Time estimate:** 45–60 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** None  
**Expected outcome:** A clear agency niche that supports premium pricing and clear positioning.

Open the [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md). Part 1: expertise and market (what you do, who buys it). Part 2: demand and competition (who else serves this niche, what they charge). Part 3: niche statement and differentiator (one sentence + what makes you different). Part 4: validation (who would pay, proof points).

**Option A (Using AI):** *"I want to run a solo agency. My expertise is [X]. What niches could I focus on that support $2k–$5k/month with clear positioning?"*

Open the [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md). Part 1: core offer (what you do). Part 2: packages (e.g. Starter, Growth, Premium) with scope and price per package. Part 3: add-ons and boundaries (what's in, what's out). Part 4: positioning vs competitors (how you're different, proof points).

**Option A (Using AI):** *"My agency niche is [X]. I offer [services]. Draft 3 package names with scope and suggested price ranges for a solo operator targeting $2k–$5k/month."*

Part 2: goals and pain points (what they want, what keeps them up at night). Part 3: buying triggers and objections (what makes them buy, what holds them back). Part 4: one-paragraph client avatar (synthesis you can use in proposals and outreach).

**Option A (Using AI):** *"My agency serves [niche]. Write a one-paragraph ideal client avatar including demographics, goals, pain points, and buying triggers."*
