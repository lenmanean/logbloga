# Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy

How to plan and track revenue, pricing by tier, and when to scale the team so you can reach $5,000–$15,000/month at Level 2.

## Purpose

A clear team pricing and revenue strategy (revenue mix, when to scale team, pricing by tier, team cost and revenue-per-head) keeps you on track to $5,000–$15,000/month at Level 2. For small team agency (6–8 weeks time investment, $300–800 platform costs), this guide helps you set revenue goals, price by tier, plan team cost and revenue-per-head, and know when to add capacity. Use with the [Team Budget Planner](agency-level-2-team-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section. Without it, you'll undercharge, overhire, or burn out the team.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 60–75 minutes initial; 45 minutes monthly review  
- **When:** Use in Phase 1 (with [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md)) and Phase 4 of the [Level 2 Implementation Plan](agency-level-2-plan.md); update monthly with the Team Budget Planner (PDF).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft a simple revenue model ("We need $10k/month with 5 clients; our tiers are $1.5k, $2.8k, $4.5k; how many of each tier? What's revenue-per-head if we have 3 people?"); then personalize.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in proposals, capacity planning, and the [Team Budget Planner](agency-level-2-team-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF).

## Part 1: Revenue Goals and Mix

### What you're aiming for and how you'll get there

**Revenue goal (Level 2 band: $5,000–$15,000/month):**
_________________________________________________

**Tier mix (from [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md)):**
- Tier 1 (e.g. Starter): $_________/month — target _____ clients
- Tier 2 (e.g. Growth): $_________/month — target _____ clients
- Tier 3 (e.g. Premium): $_________/month — target _____ clients

**Simple revenue model (e.g. X clients at Tier A + Y at Tier B = target):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Goal: $10,000/month. Mix: 2 Starter at $1,500, 2 Growth at $2,800, 1 Premium at $4,500 = $11,100. So we need 5 clients: 2 Starter, 2 Growth, 1 Premium (or 3 Growth + 1 Starter = $9,900)."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Revenue goal written; [ ] Tier mix and client count clear; [ ] Aligned with Service Suite Development and capacity (see Part 3)

## Part 2: Pricing by Tier and When to Raise

### Minimum price per tier and when to increase

**Pricing floor per tier (below this you won't take a client at that tier):**
- Tier 1: $_________/month
- Tier 2: $_________/month
- Tier 3: $_________/month

**When to raise rates:**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. at renewal after 6–12 months; when you add a case study per tier; when you're at 80%+ capacity.)

**How you'll communicate a raise:**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. "We're raising rates to $X/month starting [date] to reflect our current scope and market. Your current rate is locked until [renewal date].")

**Example:** "Starter floor: $1,200; Growth floor: $2,200; Premium floor: $3,500. We'll raise at renewal after 12 months or when we add a case study for that tier. We'll say: 'Rates are rising to $X starting [date]; your rate is locked until [renewal].'"

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Floor per tier set; [ ] You know when and how you'll raise; [ ] You won't take clients below floor without a written pilot (e.g. case study in exchange)

## Part 3: Team Cost and Revenue-per-Head

### How much the team costs and how much revenue each person supports

**Current team (roles and approximate cost):**
- Role 1 (e.g. Owner): $_________/month (salary, draw, or equivalent)
- Role 2 (e.g. Delivery lead): $_________/month
- Role 3 (e.g. Account manager): $_________/month
- Role 4 (if applicable, e.g. Specialist): $_________/month
- **Total team cost:** $_________/month

**Contractors (if any):**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. "Designer: $X per project; Writer: $Y/month retainer.")

**Revenue target (from Part 1):** $_________/month

**Revenue-per-head (revenue ÷ number of people, or revenue ÷ full-time equivalents):**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. "$10,000 ÷ 3 people = ~$3,333 per person. We need each person to support at least $2,500–$3,000 in revenue to cover cost and margin.")

**When to scale team:** When revenue-per-head is consistently above $X (e.g. $4,000+) and capacity is maxed (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) Part 4), add one role (e.g. Specialist or second Delivery lead). Don't hire before you have the pipeline and revenue to support the cost.

**Example:** "Team: Owner $3,000, Delivery lead $2,500, Account manager $2,000 = $7,500/month. Revenue target $10,000. Revenue-per-head ~$3,333. We scale when we're at $12k+ and Delivery lead is at 4 clients; we'll add a Specialist at $2,000."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Team cost and revenue target clear; [ ] Revenue-per-head calculated; [ ] You know when to scale (capacity + revenue threshold)

## Part 4: Expense Categories (Platform, Tools, Other)

### What you'll track so net is clear

**Platform costs (Level 2 range: $300–800/month):**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. GoHighLevel $X, HubSpot $X, ClickUp $X, Zite $X.)

**Other expenses (tools, marketing, contract help, contractors):**
_________________________________________________

**Tax set-aside (e.g. 25–30% of profit):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Platform: GoHighLevel $297, ClickUp $19, Zite $X = ~$350/month. Other: Canva $30, contractor $500 = $530. Tax: 28% of profit set aside each month."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Expense categories listed; [ ] You're tracking in [Team Budget Planner](agency-level-2-team-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF); [ ] Tax set-aside is automatic (transfer when you get paid)

## Part 5: Monthly Review (Pipeline, Pricing, Retention)

### What you review each month so you stay on track

**Pipeline review (from [Client Acquisition Scaling Guide](agency-level-2-client-acquisition-scaling-guide.md)):**
- Leads added, calls held, proposals sent, closed won/lost
- Ratio: X leads → Y proposals → Z clients. Are we on track for next month's target?

**Pricing and tier mix:**
- Are we hitting our tier mix (e.g. 2 Starter, 2 Growth, 1 Premium)?
- Any client below floor? Plan to raise at renewal or re-scope.

**Retention (from [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md)):**
- Contracts ending in next 60 days. Renewal tasks and owner set?
- Churn: how many left, why? Any pattern (tier, service, delivery)?

**Capacity (from [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md)):**
- How many clients per person? Anyone at or over capacity?
- When do we need to hire or add a contractor?

**Example:** "Monthly review: pipeline (leads, proposals, closes); tier mix vs target; renewals (45-day tasks); churn count and reason; capacity (clients per person). If we're at 80%+ capacity and revenue is on target, we plan to add a role in 2–3 months."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline, pricing, retention, capacity on the agenda; [ ] One person (Owner) owns the review; [ ] Actions documented (e.g. 'Create renewal task for Client A'; 'Raise Tier 2 floor at next renewal')
