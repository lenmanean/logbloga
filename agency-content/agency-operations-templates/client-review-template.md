# Client Review Template (QBR / Milestone)

Template for quarterly or milestone client review: results vs goals, roadmap, feedback, upsell opportunity. Use with [Client Retention Strategies](../client-retention-strategies.md) (QBR) and [Service Suite Development](../service-suite-development.md) (tier and add-ons).

---

## 1. Results vs goals

- **Goals (from kickoff or last review):** e.g. brand awareness, leads, retention
- **Results this period:** Key metrics and deliverables; compare to goals
- **What's working:** Highlight 2–3 wins
- **What's not:** Gaps or challenges; what we'll adjust

## 2. Roadmap and next period

- **Focus for next quarter/milestone:** What we'll double down on; what we'll test or change
- **Deliverables and timeline:** High-level plan for the next period
- **Any scope or tier change:** If the client is considering more or less scope, note here and tie to [Service Suite Development](../service-suite-development.md) tier/add-ons

## 3. Feedback

- **Client feedback:** What they're happy with; what they want to improve
- **Agency feedback:** What we need from the client to deliver better (e.g. faster approval, clearer briefs)

## 4. Upsell opportunity (optional)

- **Tier or add-on:** If relevant: upgrade to next tier, add a channel, add ads, etc. Tie to [Client Retention Strategies](../client-retention-strategies.md) and [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](../agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md)
- **Next step:** e.g. "Send proposal by [date]" or "No change this quarter"
