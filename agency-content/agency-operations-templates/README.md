# Agency Operations Templates

Ready-to-use pack for running client delivery and team operations. Aligns with the [Team Management Framework](../team-management-framework.md) and [Service Suite Development](../service-suite-development.md) so every client gets consistent kickoff, status, client review, and handoff.

## What's in this pack

- **kickoff-agenda.md** — One-page agenda for the client kickoff: intro, roles, review discovery/scope, confirm timeline and first deliverables, Q&A.
- **status-report-template.md** — Biweekly or monthly client status: deliverables completed, metrics, blockers, next 2 weeks.
- **client-review-template.md** — Quarterly or milestone client review: results vs goals, roadmap, feedback, upsell opportunity.
- **handoff-checklist.md** — Internal checklist for phase or project handoff: deliverables approved, client sign-off, next phase or renewal date, tasks closed.
- **renewal-conversation-guide.md** — Short script or bullets for the 45-day and 30-day renewal check-in.

## How to use

1. Use kickoff agenda for every new client; name roles (Owner, Delivery lead, Account manager) per Team Management Framework.
2. Use status report for regular touchpoints; use client review for QBR or milestone reviews per [Client Retention Strategies](../client-retention-strategies.md).
3. Use handoff checklist when closing a phase or project; use renewal guide for renewal conversations.
4. Align scope and tier with [Service Suite Development](../service-suite-development.md) and [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](../agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md).
