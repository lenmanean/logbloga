# Renewal Conversation Guide

Short script or bullet points for the 45-day and 30-day renewal check-in. Use with [Client Retention Strategies](../client-retention-strategies.md) renewal process and [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](../agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md).

---

## When to use

- **45 days before renewal:** First check-in. How are we doing? What's next? Any changes to scope or goals?
- **30 days before renewal:** Second check-in. Confirm renewal offer (same scope, upgrade, or adjust). Send proposal or updated SOW if needed.

## 45-day check-in (bullets)

- How are we doing? Any wins or concerns?
- What's working well? What could we improve?
- Goals for the next period—same or different?
- Any change in scope (more, less, or same)?
- We'll send a renewal summary and proposal by [date]; happy to jump on a call to discuss.

## 30-day check-in (bullets)

- Renewal date is [date]. Here's what we're proposing: [same scope / upgrade / adjusted scope].
- [If proposal sent:] Have you had a chance to review? Any questions?
- Next step: sign updated SOW or confirm in writing by [date] so we can lock in the next period.
- Thank you for the partnership; we're excited to continue.

## If they're hesitant

- What would make renewal a no-brainer for you? (Listen; address if possible.)
- Would a different scope or tier fit better? (Tie to [Service Suite Development](../service-suite-development.md) options.)
- Can we do a short extension to prove value before a longer commitment?

## If they're leaving

- We're sorry to see you go. What could we have done differently?
- Can we leave the door open for a future engagement? (e.g. pause vs cancel.)
- Final deliverables and handoff: we'll complete [X] by [date] and send a handoff summary.
