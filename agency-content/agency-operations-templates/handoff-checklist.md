# Handoff Checklist

Internal checklist for phase or project handoff. Use with [Team Management Framework](../team-management-framework.md) (Delivery to Client and Feedback to Delivery). Ensures deliverables are approved, client sign-off is in place, and tasks are closed in ClickUp (or equivalent).

---

## Before handoff

- [ ] **Deliverables approved** — All agreed deliverables for this phase/project are complete and approved by the client.
- [ ] **Client sign-off** — Client has confirmed acceptance (email, form, or call note).
- [ ] **Next phase or renewal date** — If there is a next phase or renewal, date and owner are set; client knows what to expect.

## Handoff steps

- [ ] **Tasks closed** — All tasks for this phase/project are marked complete in ClickUp (or your task tool).
- [ ] **Knowledge transfer** — If handing off to another team member (e.g. Delivery to Account manager for renewal), key context is passed (goals, history, client quirks).
- [ ] **Billing and contracts** — Invoices for this phase are sent/paid; contract or SOW is updated if needed.

## After handoff

- [ ] **Archive or file** — Project/phase folder or client file is archived or filed so it's findable later.
- [ ] **Retro (optional)** — Quick note on what went well and what to improve for next time.
