# Hello Bonsai Setup

Step-by-step setup for Hello Bonsai so you can send contracts and invoices for your solo agency—supporting $2,000–$5,000/month (Option B).

## Overview

**Option B (Best-of-Breed).** Hello Bonsai gives you contracts, invoicing, and client agreements for a solo agency. For Level 1 ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), Option B means using Hello Bonsai for contracts and invoicing alongside [HubSpot free](hubspot-free-setup.md) (CRM) and [ClickUp free](clickup-free-setup.md) (tasks). This guide covers account, contract templates, invoice setup, and client onboarding workflow.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option B (Best-of-Breed)**. Use it with [HubSpot Free Setup](hubspot-free-setup.md) and [ClickUp Free Setup](clickup-free-setup.md) for the full Option B stack. If you chose **Option A (All-in-One)** with Systeme.io, you may still use Hello Bonsai for contracts only (hybrid); otherwise use Systeme.io for contracts and invoicing.

## Prerequisites

- Email address for Hello Bonsai sign-up
- [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) and [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) completed or in progress (for contract scope and payment terms)
- [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) for payment terms and pricing
- Optional: [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) for alignment

**Time:** About 45–60 minutes total (account and contract ~20 min; invoice ~15 min; onboarding workflow ~10–15 min).

## Step 1: Create Account and Profile

**Time estimate:** 5–10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a Hello Bonsai account and complete your profile so contracts and invoices show your business name and details.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [hellobonsai.com](https://www.hellobonsai.com) and sign up (free trial or free tier if available). Use your work email.
2. **Complete profile:** Add your business name (or your name if solo), email, phone (optional), and address. This appears on contracts and invoices.
3. **Payment method (if paid plan):** If you choose a paid plan, add a payment method. Free tier may have limits on contracts or invoices; check the plan.
4. **Verify:** You can access the dashboard and see **Contracts**, **Invoices**, and **Clients** (or equivalent).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Hello Bonsai account created; [ ] Profile complete (business name, email, address); [ ] Dashboard accessible

## Step 2: Contract Templates

**Time estimate:** 20–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create at least one contract template (service agreement) so you can send consistent, professional contracts to every new client.

### Sub-steps

1. In Hello Bonsai, go to **Contracts** (or **Templates**). Create a new contract or template.
2. **Choose type:** Select "Service Agreement" or "Independent Contractor Agreement" (or equivalent). Use the template that fits your offer (e.g. retainer, project-based).
3. **Edit sections:** Replace the template slots with your terms. Include: **Parties** (you and client name/company), **Scope of work** (from your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) — deliverables, what's in and out), **Payment terms** (from your [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) — e.g. 50% upfront, 50% on delivery; or net 15), **Term and termination** (start date, end date or month-to-month, notice period), **Intellectual property** (who owns work product), **Confidentiality** (if relevant). Keep language clear; optionally have a lawyer review once.
4. **Save as template:** Save the contract as a template so you can reuse it. Name it (e.g. "Agency service agreement – Retainer" or "Project-based agreement").
5. **Test:** Create a new contract from the template, add a test client name and company, and send it to yourself. E-sign and confirm you receive a copy. You're ready to use it for real clients.
6. **Align with onboarding:** When you close a deal (in HubSpot or Systeme.io), send this contract as step 1 of your [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) workflow (welcome → contract → kickoff).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one contract template created; [ ] Scope, payment, and term sections filled; [ ] Test contract sent and e-signed; [ ] You know how to send from template for new clients

## Step 3: Invoice Setup

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up invoice templates and payment options so you can get paid on time and track revenue.

### Sub-steps

1. In Hello Bonsai, go to **Invoices**. Create a new invoice or invoice template.
2. **Invoice fields:** Add your business name and logo (if you have one). Add client name, company, email. Add line items: description (e.g. "Retainer – [Month]" or "Project – [Deliverable name]"), quantity, rate, amount. Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) package prices and [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) payment terms.
3. **Payment terms:** Set due date (e.g. Net 15, Due on receipt, or Due by [date]). Add payment instructions (e.g. "Pay via link below" or "Bank transfer / check"). If Hello Bonsai supports online payment (Stripe, PayPal), connect it so clients can pay by card or link.
4. **Save as template:** Save the invoice as a template (e.g. "Retainer invoice" or "Project invoice") so you can duplicate and edit for each client/month.
5. **Test:** Create an invoice from the template, add a test client and amount, and send it to yourself. Confirm you receive it and (if applicable) the payment link works.
6. **Track in Solo Budget Worksheet:** Record income in your [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section when payments are received. Use Hello Bonsai's invoice status (Sent, Paid, Overdue) to follow up.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one invoice template created; [ ] Payment terms and (if applicable) online payment set; [ ] Test invoice sent; [ ] You know how to send and track invoices for clients

## Step 4: Client Onboarding Workflow

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Tie contracts and invoices to your client onboarding so every new client gets the same professional flow.

### Sub-steps

1. **Document the flow:** When a deal closes (in HubSpot or elsewhere), step 1: Send welcome email (from your [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP)). Step 2: Send contract (Hello Bonsai template). Step 3: On signature, send first invoice (if 50% upfront or first month retainer). Step 4: Schedule kickoff call (in your calendar or HubSpot). Step 5: Add client to ClickUp and create delivery tasks. Write this in a short checklist (or use the Client Onboarding Template ZIP) so you repeat it every time.
2. **Use Hello Bonsai in the flow:** Contract send → E-sign → Invoice send (first payment) → Mark client as "Active" or add to your CRM. Optionally set a reminder to send the next invoice (e.g. monthly retainer) in Hello Bonsai or your calendar.
3. **Verify:** You have a clear sequence: close deal → contract → invoice → kickoff → delivery. Hello Bonsai handles contract and invoice; you handle welcome, kickoff, and delivery in other tools.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Onboarding flow documented (welcome → contract → invoice → kickoff → delivery); [ ] Hello Bonsai used for contract and invoice in that flow; [ ] You're ready to onboard first client
