# Target Client Framework

Guided exercises to define your ideal client so outreach and positioning are focused—supporting $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency.

## Purpose

A clear target client (demographics, goals, pain points, buying triggers) makes outreach and proposals more effective. For Level 1 solo agency ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), defining who you serve and why they buy helps you land first clients faster. Without it, you'll spray and pray and waste time on bad-fit leads.

They're frustrated because content is ad hoc and they've been burned by generic agencies. They'll buy when they see proof in their space (case study, testimonial) and clear scope and price. They choose us because we're B2B-only and deliver in 2-week sprints so they can see results fast."
