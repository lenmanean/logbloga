# Team Management Framework

Guided exercises to define roles, handoffs, and meeting cadence so your 2–5 person team can run 5–10 clients without chaos—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month at Level 2.

## Purpose

Clear team structure (roles, handoffs, meeting cadence) prevents dropped balls and scope creep. For Level 2 small team agency ($5,000–$15,000/month, 6–8 weeks, $300–800 platform costs), defining who does what, how work passes between people, and when you meet keeps delivery and client relationships consistent. Without it, clients get mixed messages and work falls through the cracks.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 60–75 minutes  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 1 of the [Level 2 Implementation Plan](agency-level-2-plan.md) (Platforms and Team Structure); before or alongside [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and platform setup ([GoHighLevel](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) or [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md), [ClickUp paid](clickup-paid-setup.md), [Zite](zite-setup-guide.md)).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft "agency team roles and handoffs for 3-person team" or "client account manager vs delivery lead responsibilities"; then customize for your size and services.

## Part 1: Roles and Responsibilities (Fill-In)

### Who does what

**Role 1 (e.g. Owner / Lead):**  
Responsibilities: _________________________________________________  
Client-facing?: _________________________________________________

**Role 2 (e.g. Delivery Lead / Project Manager):**  
Responsibilities: _________________________________________________  
Client-facing?: _________________________________________________

**Role 3 (e.g. Account Manager / Client Success):**  
Responsibilities: _________________________________________________  
Client-facing?: _________________________________________________

**Role 4 (if applicable, e.g. Specialist / Creator):**  
Responsibilities: _________________________________________________  
Client-facing?: _________________________________________________

**Example:** "Owner: strategy, sales, final approval, key client relationships. Delivery lead: day-to-day delivery, task assignment, internal deadlines. Account manager: client check-ins, status reports, renewals and upsell. Specialist: execution (content, design, ads). Owner and account manager client-facing; delivery lead and specialist mostly internal unless needed."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 2–3 roles defined; [ ] Responsibilities and client-facing clarity; [ ] No major gap (e.g. who owns renewals?)

## Part 2: Handoffs (Fill-In)

### How work passes between people

**Lead → Delivery (when a deal closes):**  
Who notifies whom: _________________________________________________  
What gets passed (contract, SOW, kickoff date): _________________________________________________  
Where it’s documented (pipeline, ClickUp, etc.): _________________________________________________

**Delivery → Client (when sending a deliverable):**  
Who sends: _________________________________________________  
Who reviews client feedback: _________________________________________________  
Who approves before sending: _________________________________________________

**Client feedback → Delivery (revision or new phase):**  
Who triages: _________________________________________________  
Who updates tasks and due dates: _________________________________________________  
Who communicates timeline to client: _________________________________________________

**Renewal or upsell (who owns, when):**  
Owner: _________________________________________________  
When (e.g. 30 days before contract end): _________________________________________________

**Example:** "Lead → Delivery: Owner moves deal to 'Closed won' and assigns account manager; account manager creates kickoff in ClickUp and adds client to Zite. Delivery → Client: Delivery lead prepares draft; account manager sends via Zite and collects feedback. Feedback → Delivery: Account manager summarizes feedback; delivery lead updates tasks and due dates; account manager tells client new timeline. Renewal: Account manager owns; check-in 45 days before end; Owner closes upsell or renewal."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Lead→Delivery, Delivery→Client, Feedback→Delivery, Renewal clear; [ ] One owner per handoff; [ ] Documented in playbook or templates

## Part 3: Meeting Cadence (Fill-In)

### When you meet and what you cover

**Internal (team) — frequency and agenda:**  
Frequency: _________________________________________________  
Agenda (e.g. pipeline, blockers, capacity): _________________________________________________  
Owner: _________________________________________________

**Client check-ins — frequency and owner:**  
Frequency: _________________________________________________  
Owner: _________________________________________________  
Format (call, email, report): _________________________________________________

**Pipeline / sales review — frequency and owner:**  
Frequency: _________________________________________________  
Owner: _________________________________________________  
What you review (deal count, value, next steps): _________________________________________________

**Example:** "Internal: Weekly 30-min standup (Mondays). Agenda: pipeline update, client blockers, capacity. Owner: Delivery lead. Client check-ins: Biweekly 15-min call per client; account manager. Pipeline review: Weekly 15 min with Owner; deal count by stage, proposals out, follow-ups."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Internal, client, and pipeline cadence set; [ ] Owner for each; [ ] Realistic for 2–5 person team

---

## Part 4: Capacity and Escalation (Fill-In)

### How much work each role can carry and when to escalate

**Capacity (e.g. X clients per delivery lead, Y accounts per account manager):**  
_________________________________________________

**Escalation (when to bring in Owner or change scope):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Capacity: 1 delivery lead can run 3–4 active clients; 1 account manager can own 5–8 client relationships. Escalation: Scope change or client conflict → Owner. Missed deadline or quality issue → Delivery lead then Owner if not resolved."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Capacity per role noted; [ ] Escalation path clear

## Worked Example 1: 3-Person Team (Owner, Delivery Lead, Account Manager)

**Roles:** Owner does sales, strategy, and final approval; Delivery lead runs projects and tasks; Account manager does client comms, status, renewals.

**Handoffs:** Owner closes deal and assigns account manager; account manager sets kickoff in ClickUp and adds client to Zite. Delivery lead owns task updates; account manager sends deliverables and feedback to client. Renewals: account manager at 45 days out; Owner closes.

**Cadence:** Weekly internal standup (Delivery lead runs). Biweekly client call (Account manager). Weekly pipeline with Owner (15 min).

**Capacity:** Delivery lead: 4 clients; Account manager: 6–8 clients. Escalate scope or conflict to Owner.

---

## Worked Example 2: 4-Person Team (Owner, Delivery Lead, Account Manager, Specialist)

**Roles:** Owner: sales and strategy; Delivery lead: project and task management; Account manager: client success and renewals; Specialist: execution (content, design, or ads).

**Handoffs:** Same as Example 1 for lead→delivery and renewal. Delivery lead assigns tasks to Specialist; Specialist delivers to Delivery lead; Delivery lead or Account manager sends to client via Zite. Feedback flows back: Account manager → Delivery lead → Specialist.

**Cadence:** Same internal and client cadence. Add a short daily or 3x/week sync between Delivery lead and Specialist for task priority.

**Capacity:** Delivery lead: 4–5 clients; Specialist: capacity for 3–4 clients’ execution; Account manager: 6–8 clients. Escalate to Owner for scope or conflict.
