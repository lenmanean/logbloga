# ClickUp Free Setup

Step-by-step setup for ClickUp (free) so you can manage tasks and delivery for clients—supporting $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency (Option B).

## Overview

**Option B (Best-of-Breed).** ClickUp free gives you project and task management so delivery stays organized. For Level 1 solo agency ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), Option B means using ClickUp for tasks and delivery alongside [HubSpot free](hubspot-free-setup.md) (CRM) and [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) (contracts). This guide covers workspace, spaces/lists for clients or projects, tasks and due dates, and templates for repeatable delivery.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option B (Best-of-Breed)**. Use it with [HubSpot Free Setup](hubspot-free-setup.md) and [Hello Bonsai Setup](hello-bonsai-setup.md) for the full Option B stack. If you chose **Option A (All-in-One)** with Systeme.io, use the [Systeme.io Setup Guide](systeme-io-setup-guide.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

- Email address for ClickUp sign-up
- [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) completed (to define deliverables and task types)
- Optional: [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) from the Templates section for alignment

**Time:** About 45–60 minutes total (workspace and spaces ~20 min; tasks and due dates ~15 min; templates ~15–20 min).

## Step 1: Create Workspace and First Space

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a ClickUp workspace and at least one space (e.g. "Client work") so you can organize tasks by client or project.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [clickup.com](https://clickup.com) and sign up for a **free** account. Use your work email.
2. **Create workspace:** Name it (e.g. "[Your Agency] Workspace"). This is the top-level container.
3. **Create a space:** Inside the workspace, create a **Space** (e.g. "Client work" or "Delivery"). Spaces are like folders; use one space for all client delivery or one space per client if you prefer.
4. **Create a list:** Inside the space, create a **List** (e.g. "Client A – Project 1" or "General delivery"). Lists hold tasks. For Level 1, you can start with one list per client project or one list for "Active delivery" and use tags for client name.
5. **Verify:** You see Workspace → Space → List. You're ready to add tasks.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] ClickUp account and workspace created; [ ] At least one space and one list created; [ ] You know how to add more lists (e.g. per client)

## Step 2: Tasks and Due Dates

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Add tasks with due dates so you can track deliverables and deadlines without dropping balls.

### Sub-steps

1. In your list, **create a task.** Name it (e.g. "Kickoff call," "Deliver draft 1," "Final review"). Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) deliverables to define task types (e.g. Discovery, Draft 1, Revision, Final delivery).
2. **Set due date:** Open the task and set a due date (and optionally time). Use your [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) kickoff and delivery timeline to set first-week tasks.
3. **Add description (optional):** In the task description, add scope or notes (e.g. "Deliverable: 1-page strategy doc per package"). This keeps context in one place.
4. **Status:** Use the default status (e.g. To Do, In Progress, Complete) or create custom statuses (e.g. "Waiting on client," "In review"). Move the task through statuses as you work.
5. **Repeat:** Add 3–5 tasks for one client or one project so you have a clear sequence. Optionally assign tasks to yourself (solo) or leave unassigned if you're the only one.
6. **Test:** Complete one task (mark Complete) so you see how status and due dates work. Use the list view or board view (if available on free) to see all tasks.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 3–5 tasks created with due dates; [ ] Statuses used (e.g. To Do → In Progress → Complete); [ ] You know how to add and update tasks for each client

## Step 3: Templates for Repeatable Delivery

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a task or list template so you can repeat the same delivery structure for every new client without rebuilding from scratch.

### Sub-steps

1. In ClickUp, **create a list** (e.g. "Template – New client delivery") with the standard tasks you do for every client. Example: Kickoff call → Discovery summary → Draft 1 → Client review → Revision → Final delivery → Retro/feedback. Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) scope and [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) checklist.
2. **Set due date offsets (if available):** If your plan supports it, set relative due dates (e.g. "Kickoff + 2 days" for Discovery summary). Otherwise, you'll set dates manually when you duplicate.
3. **Save as template (if available):** If ClickUp free allows list or task templates, save this list as a template. Name it (e.g. "New client onboarding + delivery"). Otherwise, duplicate the list and rename it for each new client (e.g. "Client B – Project 1").
4. **Use for next client:** When you sign a new client, duplicate the template list (or copy the list) and rename it. Set kickoff date and adjust due dates for each task. Optionally add client name as a tag or in the list name.
5. **Verify:** You have a repeatable structure so every new client gets the same delivery sequence. Update the template over time as you refine your process.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one list or task template created (or list duplicated for reuse); [ ] Template matches your service package deliverables; [ ] You used or duplicated it for a test "client"

## What You'll Have When Done

- ClickUp free workspace with at least one space and list
- Tasks with due dates and statuses for client delivery
- A repeatable template (or duplicated list) for new client onboarding and delivery

**Use with HubSpot (CRM) and Hello Bonsai (contracts) for full Option B stack.** See [HubSpot Free Setup](hubspot-free-setup.md) and [Hello Bonsai Setup](hello-bonsai-setup.md).

**Time estimate summary:** Step 1 ~15–20 min; Step 2 ~15–20 min; Step 3 ~15–20 min. **Total: ~45–60 minutes.**
