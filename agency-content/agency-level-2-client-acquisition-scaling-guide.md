# Client Acquisition Scaling Guide

How to scale client acquisition so your 2–5 person team can fill and maintain a pipeline of 5–10 clients—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month at Level 2.

## Overview

Scaling acquisition (who to target at scale, offer, outreach systems, pipeline math) turns your Level 2 team and platforms into predictable revenue. This guide covers who to target at scale (using your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) tiers and [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md)), what to offer (tiers and add-ons), how to systematize outreach (sequences, booking links, pipeline stages), and how to use pipeline math (e.g. X leads → Y proposals → Z clients). Time investment: 6–8 weeks; platform costs $300–800/month; expected revenue $5,000–$15,000/month when you have 5–10 clients. See also [Team & Portfolio Checklist](agency-level-2-team-portfolio-checklist.md) for case studies and proposals.

## Why Scaling Acquisition Matters

At Level 2 you need more than 1–2 clients to hit $5k–$15k/month. Without a system (who to target, how to reach them, how many leads you need), you rely on luck. This guide turns your service suite and team into a repeatable pipeline so you can fill capacity and plan hiring or capacity.

## Step 1: Who to Target at Scale (Using Service Suite and Target Client)

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to define; ongoing to refine  
**Purpose:** Focus outreach on segments that match your tiers so you don't waste time on bad-fit leads.

### Sub-steps

1. **Use your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md).** Map each tier to an ideal client type (size, industry, need). Example: Starter = first-time buyers, small teams; Growth = established marketing teams; Premium = teams with budget and complexity.
2. **Use your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md)** (from Level 1) for demographics and firmographics: job title, company size, industry. Refine for Level 2: e.g. "Marketing director at B2B SaaS, 20–100 employees, $1M+ revenue."
3. **List 20–50 target accounts or contacts** (not just 10–20). Use LinkedIn, your network, past clients for referrals, or a simple list/CRM. Prioritize warm and referral; add cold (e.g. LinkedIn, email) once you have a repeatable message and booking link.
4. **Segment by tier (optional):** If you have distinct tiers, segment your list (e.g. "Starter-fit" vs "Growth-fit") so you can tailor messaging and proposal. Track in [GoHighLevel](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) or [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md) with tags or custom fields.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] 20–50 target leads or accounts listed; [ ] Segments align with service tiers; [ ] You're filtering by Target Client and Service Suite

## Step 2: Offer (Tiers and Add-Ons)

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes (tiers already defined)  
**Purpose:** Lead with one clear offer per segment so the prospect knows what they're getting and what it costs.

### Sub-steps

1. **Use your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md).** In outreach, lead with the tier that fits the prospect (Starter for testing, Growth for core, Premium for high-touch). Don't list all three in the first message; say what you do and one outcome or range.
2. **One primary offer per conversation.** In the first touch: "We help [target client] with [core offer]. Typical engagement is [tier name] at $X/month for [brief scope]. Worth a 15-min call?" In the proposal, show 2–3 tiers and recommend one.
3. **Add-ons.** Mention add-ons in the proposal (e.g. extra deliverable, strategy call) so the client knows they can expand. Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) for pricing.
4. **Price clarity.** Include price or range in the proposal. Use your pricing floor; don't go below it to "fill capacity" unless you have a clear pilot (e.g. 3 months at discount for a case study).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] You lead with one clear offer per segment; [ ] Proposal shows tiers and price; [ ] Add-ons and pricing floor clear

## Step 3: Outreach Systems (Sequences, Booking, Pipeline)

**Time estimate:** 1–2 hours to set up; 15–30 min per day to run  
**Purpose:** Systematize outreach so the team spends less time on one-off messages and more on calls and proposals.

### Sub-steps

1. **Sequences (GoHighLevel or HubSpot paid).** Create a 3–5 email sequence for new leads: welcome, value (case study or offer), "Book a call" or "Reply if interested." Use merge fields (first name, company). Set trigger: contact added to pipeline or list. See [GoHighLevel Setup Guide](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) or [HubSpot Paid Setup](hubspot-paid-setup.md).
2. **Booking link.** Publish a booking link (discovery or strategy call) in sequences, email signature, and website. When they book, create or update the contact and deal in your CRM. Assign owner (round-robin or manual). Document in [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md).
3. **Pipeline stages.** Use clear stages: Lead → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Closed won (or Closed lost). Move deals when you send a proposal, when they reply, when they close. This feeds pipeline math (next step).
4. **Volume.** Aim for 10–20 new outreach actions per week (messages, emails, or referral asks) across the team. Track in CRM; review weekly in pipeline meeting (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md)).

**Example sequence (email 1):** "Hi [First name], we help [target client] with [core offer]. [Company] looks like a fit for [brief reason]. Worth a 15-min call? [Booking link] [Your name]"

**Example sequence (email 3):** "Hi [First name], following up—if timing isn't right, no problem. If you'd like to explore [offer], here's the link again: [Booking link]. [Your name]"

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one sequence live with trigger; [ ] Booking link works and creates contact/deal; [ ] Pipeline stages updated when you send proposals and close

## Step 4: Pipeline Math (X Leads → Y Proposals → Z Clients)

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to model; review monthly  
**Purpose:** Know how many leads and proposals you need to hit your client and revenue targets so you can plan capacity and hiring.

### Sub-steps

1. **Define your ratios.** Track for 4–8 weeks (or use industry benchmarks): How many leads (new contacts in pipeline) → discovery calls? How many calls → proposals sent? How many proposals → closed won? Example: 20 leads → 5 calls → 3 proposals → 1 client. So to get 2 new clients per month, you need ~40 leads, ~10 calls, ~6 proposals (rough).
2. **Work backward from revenue target.** Example: Target $10k/month with 5 clients at ~$2k/month average. You need to replace churn (e.g. 1 client per quarter) and add 1–2 new clients per quarter to grow. So you need ~2 new clients per quarter = ~7 leads per month (if 20 leads → 1 client). Scale up outreach to hit lead volume.
3. **Review monthly.** In your pipeline meeting, review: leads added, calls held, proposals sent, closed won/lost. Adjust ratios as you get data. Use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md) for revenue mix and when to scale team.
4. **Document.** Write down your current ratios and target lead volume in a simple doc or dashboard. Update every month so the team knows what "good" looks like.

**Example pipeline math:** "We need 2 new clients per month. Our ratio: 15 leads → 4 calls → 2 proposals → 1 client. So we need 30 leads/month, 8 calls, 4 proposals. We're doing 20 leads/month now—increase LinkedIn and referral asks to hit 30."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Ratios defined (leads → calls → proposals → closed); [ ] Revenue target and client count aligned; [ ] Monthly review in place

## Step 5: Proposals and Close (Team-Owned)

**Time estimate:** 45–60 minutes per proposal (first ones; faster with templates)  
**Purpose:** Send clear, professional proposals so prospects can say yes quickly; hand off to the right owner for close.

### Sub-steps

1. **Proposal structure (1–2 pages):** Summary (who you are, what you do, why you're a fit); Scope (deliverables from tier—use [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md)); Investment (price and payment terms—use [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md)); Next step ("Sign contract and we'll schedule kickoff by [date]").
2. **Personalize.** Use their name, company, and one line from discovery or research. Add one proof point (case study, result) from your [Team & Portfolio Checklist](agency-level-2-team-portfolio-checklist.md).
3. **Owner.** Per [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md), Owner or designated closer sends the proposal and follows up. When they say yes, hand off to Account manager for contract and kickoff (see [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP)).
4. **Follow up.** If no reply in 3–5 days, one short follow-up. Don't chase more than 2–3 times. Move to Closed lost if no response after 2–3 touches and free the pipeline for the next lead.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Proposal template in use; [ ] Owner clear; [ ] Handoff to Account manager on close; [ ] Follow-up and close/lost process clear
