# HubSpot Paid Setup

Step-by-step setup for HubSpot (paid) so you can manage leads and clients with CRM, marketing, and sales tools for a 2–5 person team—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month (Option B).

## Overview

**Option B (Best-of-Breed).** HubSpot paid gives you CRM, marketing, and sales tools with more users, automation, and reporting. For Level 2 small team agency ($5,000–$15,000/month, 6–8 weeks, $300–800 platform costs), Option B means using HubSpot paid for CRM, deals, and marketing; [ClickUp paid](clickup-paid-setup.md) for tasks and delivery; and [Zite](zite-setup-guide.md) for client deliverables and approvals. This guide covers account and plan selection, team and permissions, pipeline and deals, marketing automation, and reporting.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option B (Best-of-Breed)**. Use it together with [ClickUp Paid Setup](clickup-paid-setup.md) and [Zite Setup Guide](zite-setup-guide.md) for the full Option B stack. If you chose **Option A (GoHighLevel)**, use the [GoHighLevel Setup Guide](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

- Email address and payment method for HubSpot paid plan (Sales Hub, Marketing Hub, or bundle)
- [Level 1 complete or equivalent](agency-level-1-plan.md) (niche, service packages, first clients)
- [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) in progress (roles so you can map users and pipelines)
- Optional: [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) for deal stages and handoffs

**Time:** About 1.5–2 hours total (account and team ~25 min; pipeline and deals ~30 min; marketing and reporting ~35 min).

## Step 1: Account and Plan Selection

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create or upgrade to a HubSpot paid account and choose a plan that supports 2–5 users and your pipeline volume.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [hubspot.com](https://www.hubspot.com). If you have a free account, go to **Settings** → **Account & Billing** to upgrade. Otherwise sign up and choose a **paid** plan (Sales Hub, Marketing Hub, or CRM Suite).
2. **Choose a plan:** Compare Starter vs Professional. For Level 2 (2–5 person team, 5–10 clients), Starter or Professional typically includes multiple users, pipelines, sequences, and reporting. Check user limits and contact/deal limits.
3. **Complete billing** and verify your account is active. Ensure you have at least 2 user seats if you're adding team members.
4. **Verify:** You see the main dashboard with Sales, Marketing, and (if applicable) Service or CMS. Settings are accessible for team and pipeline.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] HubSpot paid account active; [ ] Plan supports 2+ users; [ ] Dashboard and Settings accessible

## Step 2: Team and Permissions

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Add team members and set permissions so everyone has the right access to contacts, deals, and marketing assets.

### Sub-steps

1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings** → **Users & Teams** (or **Team**). Invite users by email. Assign a **role** (e.g. Super admin, Admin, Sales rep, Marketer) per your [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md).
2. **Permissions:** Restrict or allow access to Contacts, Deals, Companies, Lists, and (if applicable) Marketing campaigns and Reports. For Level 2, typical setup: owner/admin sees all; sales reps see their deals and contacts; delivery leads see assigned companies or a shared view.
3. **Team assignment (optional):** If you use teams, create a team (e.g. "Agency") and assign users. Use for reporting or round-robin deal assignment if your plan supports it.
4. **Verify:** Invited users receive an email and can log in. Confirm they see only what they should (e.g. no billing or account settings for reps).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 2 users invited and roles set; [ ] Permissions match your team structure; [ ] Users can access CRM and (if needed) marketing

## Step 3: Pipeline and Deals

**Time estimate:** 25–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up or refine your sales pipeline and deal stages so the whole team can track leads and clients from first contact to close and delivery.

### Sub-steps

1. In HubSpot, go to **Sales** → **Deals** → **Pipeline**. Open the default pipeline or create a new one (e.g. "Agency pipeline").
2. **Stages:** Edit or add stages to match your process. Example: Lead → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Closed won → Onboarded → In delivery → Renewal. Use your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) so stages align with handoffs.
3. **Deal properties (optional):** Add custom properties (e.g. Service tier, Contract value, Owner) so you can report and filter. Set "Closed won" to trigger a task or internal notification for onboarding (see [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP)).
4. **Add a test deal:** Create one contact and one deal; move the deal through two or three stages. Assign an owner and confirm visibility for the right users.
5. **Document:** Note where new leads enter (form, manual, import) and how deals are assigned. Align with [Client Acquisition Scaling Guide](agency-level-2-client-acquisition-scaling-guide.md) pipeline math.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline and stages set; [ ] At least one test deal created and moved; [ ] Deal ownership and visibility correct for team

## Step 4: Marketing Automation and Sequences

**Time estimate:** 25–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up email sequences and (if available) simple automation so the team can nurture leads and clients without manual emails every time.

### Sub-steps

1. In HubSpot, go to **Marketing** → **Email** or **Automation** (or **Sales** → **Sequences** for sales-owned sequences). Create a **sequence** (e.g. "New lead nurture").
2. **Sequence steps:** Add 3–5 steps: e.g. Email 1 (welcome), wait 2 days, Email 2 (case study or offer), wait 2 days, Email 3 ("Book a call" or "Reply"). Use templates that match your [Client Acquisition Scaling Guide](agency-level-2-client-acquisition-scaling-guide.md). Personalize with merge fields (first name, company).
3. **Enrollment:** Set enrollment criteria (e.g. contact in "Lead" lifecycle stage, or deal in "Lead" stage). Optionally add a task for a team member if the contact doesn’t reply after the sequence.
4. **Forms and lists:** Ensure your lead capture form adds contacts to the right list or lifecycle stage so they can be enrolled in sequences or campaigns. Test by submitting a form and confirming enrollment.
5. **Client touchpoints (optional):** Create a second sequence or workflow for existing clients (e.g. check-in every 30 days). Align with [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md).
6. **Test:** Enroll a test contact; confirm emails send (and tasks create if configured). Remove or pause test after verification.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one sequence created with 3+ steps; [ ] Enrollment criteria set; [ ] Test enrollment sends emails; [ ] Optional client sequence

## Step 5: Reporting and Dashboards

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a simple dashboard for pipeline value, deal count by stage, and (if available) revenue or activity.

### Sub-steps

1. In HubSpot, go to **Reports** → **Dashboards**. Create a new dashboard or open the default sales dashboard.
2. **Pipeline metrics:** Add reports for pipeline value by stage, number of deals by stage, and won/lost count or value. Use for weekly or monthly team reviews (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md)).
3. **Activity (optional):** If available, add reports for calls, emails, or meetings so you can see follow-up consistency.
4. **Share:** Share the dashboard with the team or pin it in a shared location. Document where to find it in your [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) status or review template.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Dashboard created or default opened; [ ] Pipeline and deal metrics visible; [ ] Team knows where to find the report
