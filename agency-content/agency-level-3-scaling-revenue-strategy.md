# Scaling & Revenue Strategy

How to plan and track revenue by service line, when to scale team, pricing and margin by tier, and (optional) M&A or new service lines—supporting $15,000–$50,000+/month at Level 3.

## Purpose

A clear scaling and revenue strategy (revenue by service line, when to scale team, pricing and margin by tier, M&A or new lines) keeps you on track to $15,000–$50,000+/month at Level 3. For established multi-service agency (12–16 weeks time investment, $800–2,000 platform costs), this guide helps you set revenue goals by line, price by tier with margin targets, plan team cost and revenue-per-head, and know when to add capacity or explore M&A or new lines. Use with the [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section. Without it, you'll undercharge, overhire, or miss scaling opportunities.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 90–120 minutes initial; 45–60 minutes monthly review  
- **When:** Use in Phase 1 (with [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) and [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md)) and Phase 4 of the [Level 3 Implementation Plan](agency-level-3-plan.md); update monthly with Enterprise Budget Planning (PDF).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft "agency revenue by service line P&L" or "when to scale team revenue-per-head"; then personalize.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in proposals, capacity planning, partnerships, and the [Enterprise Budget Planning](agency-level-3-enterprise-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF).

## Part 1: Revenue Goals by Service Line

### What you're aiming for and how you'll get there

**Revenue goal (Level 3 band: $15,000–$50,000+/month):**
_________________________________________________

**Revenue by service line (from [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md)):**
- Service line 1 (e.g. Content & SEO): $_________/month target — _____ clients
- Service line 2 (e.g. Paid Media): $_________/month target — _____ clients
- Service line 3 (if applicable): $_________/month target — _____ clients
- Other (e.g. Strategy, Partnerships): $_________/month target — _____ clients

**Simple revenue model (e.g. X clients at Line A + Y at Line B = target):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Goal: $35,000/month. Content & SEO: $15k (5–6 clients at $2.5k–$3k). Paid Media: $12k (3–4 clients at $3k–$4k). Strategy: $5k (1–2 projects or retainers). Partnerships: $3k (referral or revenue share). Total: $35k."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Revenue goal written; [ ] Revenue by line and client count clear; [ ] Aligned with Enterprise Service Development and capacity (see Part 3)

---

## Part 2: Pricing and Margin by Tier

### Minimum price per tier and target margin

**Pricing floor per tier (below this you won't take a client at that tier):**
- Tier 1 (e.g. Foundation): $_________/month
- Tier 2 (e.g. Core): $_________/month
- Tier 3 (e.g. Scale): $_________/month

**Target margin (after delivery cost, before overhead):**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. 25–35% per client or per line.)

**When to raise rates:**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. at renewal after 12 months; when you add a case study per line; when you're at 80%+ capacity.)

**Example:** "Foundation floor: $2k; Core floor: $4k; Scale floor: $7k. Target margin: 30%. We'll raise at renewal after 12 months or when we add a case study for that line."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Floor per tier set; [ ] Target margin set; [ ] You know when you'll raise; [ ] You won't take clients below floor without a written strategic reason (e.g. case study, reference, vertical entry)

## Part 3: Team Cost and Revenue-per-Head

### How much the team costs and how much revenue each person supports

**Current team (roles and approximate cost):**
- Role 1 (e.g. Owner): $_________/month
- Role 2 (e.g. Delivery director): $_________/month
- Role 3 (e.g. Delivery lead 1): $_________/month
- Role 4 (e.g. Delivery lead 2): $_________/month
- Role 5 (e.g. Account manager): $_________/month
- Role 6+ (if applicable): $_________/month
- **Total team cost:** $_________/month

**Contractors (if any):**
_________________________________________________

**Revenue target (from Part 1):** $_________/month

**Revenue-per-head (revenue ÷ FTE or headcount):**
_________________________________________________
(E.g. "$35,000 ÷ 7 people = ~$5,000 per person. We need each person to support at least $4k–$5k in revenue to cover cost and margin.")

**When to scale team:** When revenue-per-head is consistently above $X (e.g. $5k+) and capacity is maxed (see [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md)), add one role (e.g. Delivery lead or Specialist). Don't hire before you have the pipeline and revenue to support the cost.

**Example:** "Team: Owner $7k, Delivery director $5k, 2 Delivery leads $3.5k each, Account manager $2.5k, Specialist $2k = $23.5k/month. Revenue target $35k. Revenue-per-head ~$5k. We scale when we're at $40k+ and Delivery leads are at 4 clients each; we'll add a Delivery lead or Specialist."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Team cost and revenue target clear; [ ] Revenue-per-head calculated; [ ] You know when to scale (capacity + revenue threshold); [ ] Align with Team Scaling Guide

## Part 4: M&A or New Service Lines (Optional)

### When and how to explore M&A or new service lines

**M&A (if applicable):** When would you consider acquiring another agency or being acquired?
_________________________________________________

**New service line (if applicable):** When would you add a new service line (e.g. creative, analytics)?
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "M&A: We'd consider acquiring a complementary agency (e.g. creative) when we're at $50k+/month and have capacity to integrate. New line: We'd add analytics when 3+ clients ask for it and we have a Delivery lead who can own it."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] M&A or new line (if any) documented; [ ] Trigger and owner clear; [ ] Use in annual or quarterly planning

## Part 5: Monthly Review (Pipeline, Pricing, Retention, Partnerships)

### What you review each month so you stay on track

**Pipeline (from [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md)):**
- Leads added, proposals sent, closed won/lost by service line
- Ratio: X leads → Y proposals → Z clients. Are we on track for next month's target?

**Pricing and margin:**
- Are we hitting our tier mix and margin target per line?
- Any client below floor? Plan to raise at renewal or re-scope.

**Retention:**
- Contracts ending in next 60 days. Renewal tasks and owner set?
- Churn: how many left, why? Any pattern (line, tier, delivery)?

**Partnerships (from [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md)):**
- Pipeline and revenue by partner. Payouts on time?
- Top partners: double down. Underperformers: fix or end.

**Capacity (from [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md)):**
- How many clients per person? Anyone at or over capacity?
- When do we need to hire or add a contractor?

**Example:** "Monthly review: pipeline by line; pricing and margin by tier; retention (renewals, churn); partnerships (revenue, payouts); capacity (clients per person). If we're at 80%+ capacity and revenue is on target, we plan to add a role in 2–3 months."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline, pricing, retention, partnerships, capacity on the agenda; [ ] One person (Owner) owns the review; [ ] Actions documented (e.g. 'Create renewal task for Client A'; 'Raise Tier 2 floor at next renewal'; 'Add Delivery lead in Q2')
