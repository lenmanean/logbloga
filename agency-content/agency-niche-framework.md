# Agency Niche Framework

Guided exercises to choose an agency niche that supports premium pricing and clear positioning so you can reach $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency.

## Purpose

A clear agency niche helps you position above generic "we do marketing" and charge premium rates. For Level 1 solo agency ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), choosing a niche that matches your expertise and market demand makes it easier to define service packages, target the right clients, and land first clients. Without it, you sound like everyone else and compete on price.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes  
- **When:** Complete early in Level 1 (Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](agency-level-1-plan.md)); before Service Package Framework and Target Client Framework.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to brainstorm niches from your expertise ("What agency niches could I focus on given [my background] that support $2k–$5k/month?"), then choose and personalize.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in the [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) and [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md).
