# ClickUp Paid Setup

Step-by-step setup for ClickUp (paid) so you can manage tasks, projects, and delivery for a 2–5 person team—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month (Option B).

## Overview

**Option B (Best-of-Breed).** ClickUp paid gives you task and project management with more members, spaces, and automation. For Level 2 small team agency ($5,000–$15,000/month, 6–8 weeks, $300–800 platform costs), Option B means using [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md) for CRM and marketing, ClickUp paid for tasks and delivery, and [Zite](zite-setup-guide.md) for client deliverables and approvals. This guide covers account and plan selection, workspace and spaces, client projects and lists, team and permissions, and automation.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option B (Best-of-Breed)**. Use it together with [HubSpot Paid Setup](hubspot-paid-setup.md) and [Zite Setup Guide](zite-setup-guide.md) for the full Option B stack. If you chose **Option A (GoHighLevel)**, use the [GoHighLevel Setup Guide](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) instead; you may still use ClickUp for internal delivery if you prefer.

## Prerequisites

- Email address and payment method for ClickUp paid plan (Unlimited or Business)
- [Level 1 complete or equivalent](agency-level-1-plan.md) (niche, service packages, first clients)
- [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) in progress (roles and handoffs)
- Optional: [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) for delivery playbooks and client tiers

**Time:** About 1.5–2 hours total (account and workspace ~25 min; client structure ~35 min; team and automation ~35 min).

## Step 1: Account and Plan Selection

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create or upgrade to a ClickUp paid account and choose a plan that supports 2–5 members and multiple spaces or projects.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [clickup.com](https://clickup.com). If you have a free account, go to **Settings** → **Billing** to upgrade. Otherwise sign up and choose a **paid** plan (Unlimited or Business).
2. **Choose a plan:** Compare Unlimited vs Business. For Level 2 (2–5 person team, 5–10 clients), Unlimited typically includes unlimited members (or sufficient seats), multiple spaces, custom fields, and automation. Business adds more automation and reporting if you need it.
3. **Complete billing** and verify your account is active. Ensure you have at least 2 member seats.
4. **Verify:** You see the sidebar with Spaces, and Settings is accessible for team and billing.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] ClickUp paid account active; [ ] Plan supports 2+ members; [ ] Spaces and Settings accessible

## Step 2: Workspace and Spaces

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a workspace and spaces so you can separate client work, internal work, and (optional) templates.

### Sub-steps

1. In ClickUp, your **Workspace** is the top-level container. Create or use the default workspace (e.g. "[Your Agency] Workspace").
2. **Create spaces:** Create at least two spaces: e.g. "Client delivery" and "Internal / Ops." Optionally add "Templates" or "Playbooks" for reusable project structures (see [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md)).
3. **Client delivery space:** This space will hold one folder or list per client (or per engagement). Name it clearly so the team knows where to find client work.
4. **Internal space:** Use for team meetings, hiring, process docs, or internal projects. Keep it separate from client-facing work so permissions and views stay clear.
5. **Verify:** You can switch between spaces and create folders/lists inside each.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Workspace and at least 2 spaces created; [ ] Client delivery space ready for client folders; [ ] Internal space ready for ops

## Step 3: Client Projects and Lists

**Time estimate:** 25–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a repeatable structure for client work (e.g. one folder per client with lists for phases or deliverables) so the team can track progress and hand off cleanly.

### Sub-steps

1. In the **Client delivery** space, create a **folder** for one client (e.g. "Client A" or use a naming convention like "ClientName – ServiceTier"). This folder will hold lists and tasks for that client.
2. **Lists inside the folder:** Create lists that match your delivery process. Example: "Kickoff & discovery," "Phase 1 – [deliverable]," "Phase 2 – [deliverable]," "Review & handoff." Use your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) playbooks and [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) for phase names.
3. **Tasks and subtasks:** Add 2–3 sample tasks (e.g. "Send kickoff agenda," "Complete discovery call," "Deliver first draft"). Add assignees and due dates. Use custom fields if your plan supports it (e.g. Phase, Client, Priority).
4. **Templates (optional):** If you have a Templates space or feature, duplicate this folder structure as a template so you can create "Client B," "Client C" quickly. Document the template in your [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) spec.
5. **Verify:** Team members can see the folder and lists (once permissions are set). Tasks are assignable and have due dates.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one client folder with lists created; [ ] Sample tasks with assignees and due dates; [ ] Optional template saved for new clients

---

## Step 4: Team and Permissions

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Invite team members and set permissions so everyone has access to the right spaces, folders, and lists.

### Sub-steps

1. In ClickUp, go to **Settings** → **Team** (or click your workspace name → **Manage team**). Invite members by email. Assign a **role** (e.g. Admin, Member, Guest) per your [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md).
2. **Space permissions:** For each space, set who can view and edit. Typical Level 2 setup: "Client delivery" — all internal members can view; assign edit access by folder or list if you want client-level ownership. "Internal / Ops" — internal members only.
3. **Folder/list permissions (optional):** If you need to restrict a client folder to specific members, set folder-level permissions. Otherwise, space-level access is enough.
4. **Guests (optional):** If your plan supports it, you can add clients as guests to a specific folder or list for view-only or comment-only. Use with care; many agencies prefer to share deliverables via [Zite](zite-setup-guide.md) or email instead.
5. **Verify:** Invited members can log in and see the spaces/folders they should. They can create and assign tasks in the client folder.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 2 members invited and roles set; [ ] Space permissions match your team structure; [ ] Members can access and update client work

## Step 5: Automation and Recurring Tasks

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Add simple automation (e.g. when task status changes, assign or notify) and optional recurring tasks (e.g. weekly client check-in) so the team spends less time on manual updates.

### Sub-steps

1. In ClickUp, go to **Automations** (or open a list/folder and use the Automation tab). Create an **automation** (e.g. "When task marked complete in 'Review & handoff,' notify [Account Manager]").
2. **Trigger:** Choose "Status change" (e.g. to "Complete" or "Ready for client"). **Action:** Notify a person or create a follow-up task. Use for handoffs between delivery and account management (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md)).
3. **Recurring tasks (optional):** Create a recurring task (e.g. "Weekly client status" every Monday) in each client folder or in an "Ops" list. Assign to the account owner. Align with [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md) touchpoints.
4. **Test:** Change a task status and confirm the automation runs (notification or new task). Confirm recurring task appears on the right schedule.
5. **Document:** Note which automations you use in your [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) or internal playbook so new team members can follow.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one automation created (e.g. status change → notify); [ ] Automation runs in test; [ ] Optional recurring task for client check-ins
