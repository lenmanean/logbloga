# Enterprise Outreach Guide

How to reach enterprise buyers, position your multi-service offer, and run ABM, partnerships, events, and RFP process—supporting $15,000–$50,000+/month at Level 3.

## Overview

Enterprise outreach (enterprise buyers, multi-service offer, ABM/partnerships/events, RFP process) turns your service lines and team into predictable enterprise pipeline. This guide covers who enterprise buyers are and how they buy, what to offer (multi-service from [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md)), how to reach them (ABM-style outreach, partnerships, events), and how to run the RFP process. **2+ example positioning statements and outreach sequences** are included. Time investment: 12–16 weeks; platform costs $800–2,000/month; expected revenue $15,000–$50,000+/month when you have 10+ clients and enterprise deals. See also [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md).

## Why Enterprise Outreach Matters

At Level 3 you're selling to larger buyers (enterprise, mid-market with budget) and often through RFPs or partnerships. Without a clear offer (multi-service), positioning (why you, not a competitor), and process (ABM, RFP, partnerships), you rely on referrals only. This guide turns your enterprise service development into repeatable pipeline so you close enterprise deals and partnership-sourced revenue.

## Step 1: Who Enterprise Buyers Are and How They Buy

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to define; ongoing to refine  
**Purpose:** Focus outreach on the right title, company size, and buying process so you don't waste time on bad-fit leads.

### Sub-steps

1. **Define enterprise buyer (title, company size, budget).** Example: "VP Marketing or CMO at B2B company, 100–500 employees, $5M+ revenue; budget $10k–$30k/month for marketing services." Use [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) ideal client per service line. Refine: "Enterprise" for you might mean 50+ employees or 500+; define it once and use it in all outreach.
2. **Buying process.** Enterprise often buys through: (a) RFP (formal process, multiple bidders, legal review), (b) referral (warm intro, shorter cycle), (c) direct outreach (you reach out, they evaluate). Document which channel you'll prioritize (e.g. 50% referral, 30% RFP, 20% direct). Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) for RFP response and proposal.
3. **Decision-makers and influencers.** Identify: economic buyer (signs the check), technical buyer (evaluates scope), champion (internal advocate). Tailor messaging: economic buyer cares about ROI and risk; technical buyer cares about scope and team; champion cares about ease and results. Use in proposal and outreach (see Example positioning and sequences below).
4. **List 20–50 target accounts.** Use LinkedIn, referral, RFP boards, or partner intros. Prioritize warm and referral; add RFP and direct once you have a repeatable proposal and positioning. Track in [GoHighLevel Enterprise](gohighlevel-enterprise-setup.md) or equivalent with tags (Enterprise, RFP, Partner-referred).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Enterprise buyer defined (title, size, budget); [ ] Buying process and channels prioritized; [ ] Decision-makers and influencers clear; [ ] 20–50 target accounts listed

## Step 2: Multi-Service Offer (What to Lead With)

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes (offer already defined in Enterprise Service Development)  
**Purpose:** Lead with one clear multi-service offer per conversation so the prospect knows what they're getting and what it costs.

### Sub-steps

1. **Use your [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md).** In outreach, lead with the service line(s) that fit the prospect (e.g. Content + Paid for a full-funnel buyer; Strategy for a CMO who wants a roadmap first). Don't list every line in the first message; say what you do and one outcome or range. Example: "We help B2B enterprises grow pipeline with content, paid, and strategy—one team, one point of contact. Typical engagement $10k–$25k/month depending on scope."
2. **One primary offer per conversation.** In the first touch: who you help, what you do (one sentence), one outcome or range, one ask ("Worth a 30-min call to see if we're a fit?"). In the proposal, show 2–3 service lines and tiers; recommend one bundle or line. Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) enterprise proposal template.
3. **Price clarity.** Include price or range in the proposal. Enterprise often expects a range (e.g. $10k–$25k/month) or a detailed quote. Use your [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) pricing floor; don't go below it to "win the RFP" unless you have a strategic reason (e.g. case study, reference, entry into a new vertical).
4. **Proof.** Add 2–3 case studies (by service line or industry) and one testimonial. Use [Enterprise Service Development](enterprise-service-development.md) Part 4 (positioning and proof). Enterprise buyers want to see "someone like us."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] You lead with one clear multi-service offer per segment; [ ] Proposal shows lines and price range; [ ] Proof (case studies, testimonial) in proposal; [ ] Pricing floor respected

## Step 3: ABM-Style Outreach, Partnerships, and Events

**Time estimate:** 60–90 minutes to set up; ongoing to run  
**Purpose:** Systematize outreach so the team spends less time on one-off messages and more on calls and proposals.

### Sub-steps

1. **ABM-style outreach (account-based).** Pick 10–20 target accounts. Research each: company, recent news, key people (LinkedIn). Send personalized outreach (2–3 sentences) to the economic buyer or champion: who you are, what you do for companies like theirs, one proof point, one ask ("Worth a 30-min call?"). Use **Example positioning and sequence 1** below. Track in CRM; follow up 2–3 times over 2–3 weeks if no reply.
2. **Partnerships.** Use [Partnership Strategies](agency-level-3-partnership-strategies.md) for partner types (referral, reseller, co-marketing). Ask partners for intros to enterprise buyers. Offer referral fee or revenue share. Use **Example positioning and sequence 2** (partnership outreach) below. Track partner-sourced leads in CRM (tag "Partner: [Name]").
3. **Events (optional).** If you host or sponsor events (webinar, workshop, conference), use them to capture leads and book calls. Post-event: send follow-up email with recap and "Worth a call to explore how we could help?" Use same proposal and positioning as ABM and RFP.
4. **Volume.** Aim for 5–10 new enterprise outreach actions per week (ABM emails, partnership asks, event follow-ups). Review pipeline monthly: how many enterprise leads, proposals, closes. Use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) for revenue by channel.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] ABM-style outreach running (10–20 accounts); [ ] Partnership outreach or referrals in motion; [ ] Events (if any) followed up; [ ] Pipeline tagged and reviewed monthly

## Step 4: RFP Process (How to Respond and Win)

**Time estimate:** 2–4 hours per RFP (first few; faster with templates)  
**Purpose:** Respond to RFPs in a consistent, professional way so you win your share without burning the team.

### Sub-steps

1. **RFP receipt and triage.** When an RFP lands, Owner or Account director triages: fit (do we have the service lines and capacity?), timeline (can we deliver by their date?), budget (is it in our range?). If no, decline politely. If yes, assign owner (Owner or Account director) and delivery lead(s) for the response.
2. **RFP response structure.** Use [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP) enterprise proposal template. Include: executive summary, scope by service line, deliverables and timeline, team, investment, terms, and (if required) case studies, references, and legal/insurance. Answer every question in the RFP; use the same numbering. Keep executive summary to 1 page; full response as long as the RFP requires (often 10–20 pages).
3. **Pricing in RFP.** Provide pricing in the format they ask (e.g. by phase, by line item, or total). Don't lowball to win; use [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) margin targets. If the RFP budget is below your floor, say so and offer a reduced scope or pass.
4. **Submit and follow up.** Submit by the deadline (with buffer). If they don't confirm receipt, send a short email. After submission: one follow-up at 1 week ("Happy to answer any questions"). If they shortlist you, prepare for a presentation or call; use the same positioning and proof as the proposal.
5. **Win or lose review.** After each RFP: win or lose, note what worked and what didn't. Use for the next RFP (positioning, pricing, team slide). Document in [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) or internal playbook.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] RFP triage and owner clear; [ ] Response structure and template in use; [ ] Pricing and margin respected; [ ] Submit and follow-up process clear; [ ] Win/lose review after each RFP

## Example Positioning Statement 1 (ABM / Direct)

**One sentence:** "We help B2B enterprises grow pipeline and revenue with content, paid media, and strategy—one team, one point of contact, so you don't manage three vendors."

**Short paragraph:** "We're a multi-service agency focused on B2B. We do content & SEO, paid media, and strategy under one roof. Your Account director owns the relationship; our Delivery leads run each service line. Typical engagement is $10k–$25k/month depending on scope. We've helped [Company X] and [Company Y] achieve [result]. Worth a 30-min call to see if we're a fit for [Company]?"

**Use in:** First touch email, LinkedIn InMail, or proposal summary.

---

## Example Positioning Statement 2 (Partnership / Referral)

**One sentence:** "We partner with [consultancies / agencies / platforms] to deliver content, paid, and strategy to their clients—referral fee or revenue share, your choice."

**Short paragraph:** "We white-label or partner so you can offer content, paid, and strategy without hiring. We handle delivery; you keep the relationship. We offer [X]% referral fee or [Y]% revenue share. We've partnered with [Partner type] to deliver [result]. Worth a short call to see if we're a fit for your clients?"

**Use in:** Partnership outreach, partner portal, or referral ask.
