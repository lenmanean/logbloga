# First Agency Clients Guide

How to land your first agency clients so you can reach $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency.

## Overview

Landing your first 1–2 agency clients is the biggest lever to $2,000–$5,000/month at Level 1. This guide covers who to target (using your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md)), what to offer (your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md)), how to reach them (LinkedIn, referrals, warm network), and how to structure and close a proposal. Time investment: 3–4 weeks; platform costs $100–300/month; expected revenue $2,000–$5,000/month when you have 1–3 clients.

## Why First Agency Clients Matter

Without clients, revenue is zero. Your niche, packages, and target client are only useful when they turn into signed contracts. This guide turns your frameworks into action: outreach, proposal, and close. Use it after completing the [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md), [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md), and [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md).

## Step 1: Who to Target (Using Target Client Framework)

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes to list; ongoing to refine  
**Purpose:** Focus outreach on people and companies that match your ideal client so you don't waste time on bad-fit leads.

### Sub-steps

1. **Reopen your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md).** Part 1: job title, company size, industry. Part 4: one-paragraph avatar. Use this as your filter.
2. **List 10–20 people or companies** that fit. Use LinkedIn, your network, past employers, or referrals. Write name, company, title, and how you'll reach them (e.g. "LinkedIn," "Referral from [Name]").
3. **Prioritize warm over cold.** Warm = someone who knows you or has referred you. Cold = no prior connection. Start with 5–10 warm leads if you have them; add cold once you've sent 5–10 warm messages.
4. **Refine as you go.** If you get no reply from a segment (e.g. a certain title or industry), adjust. Double down on who responds or books calls.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] 10–20 target leads listed; [ ] At least 5 warm or semi-warm; [ ] You're filtering by Target Client Framework

## Step 2: Offer (Service Packages)

**Time estimate:** 5–10 minutes (packages already defined)  
**Purpose:** Lead with one clear offer so the prospect doesn't have to guess what you do or what it costs.

### Sub-steps

1. **Use your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md).** Lead with the package that fits the prospect (e.g. Growth if they need strategy + execution; Starter if they're testing).
2. **One primary offer per conversation.** Don't list all three packages in the first message. In the first touch, say what you do and one outcome (e.g. "We help B2B SaaS grow organic traffic with content strategy and SEO. Typical engagement is $2k–$2.5k/month for 4 blog posts + 8 LinkedIn posts + report."). In the proposal, show 2–3 packages and recommend one.
3. **Price clarity.** Include price or range in the proposal. Avoid "we'll discuss." Use your [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md) pricing floor; don't go below it to "get the first client" unless you have a clear pilot plan (e.g. 3 months at discount for a case study).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] You lead with one clear offer; [ ] Proposal shows packages and price; [ ] You have a pricing floor and stick to it

## Step 3: Outreach (LinkedIn, Referrals, Warm Network)

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to draft; 15–20 min per day to send  
**Purpose:** Get in front of 5–10 prospects per week so you have pipeline (calls booked, proposals sent).

### Sub-steps

1. **LinkedIn (if your ideal client is there):** Short connection request or InMail (2–3 sentences): who you are, what you do (one line), one ask ("Worth a 15-min call to see if we're a fit?"). Personalize with their name and company. Don't pitch the full offer in the first message; get the call.
2. **Referrals:** Ask 3–5 people you trust (past clients, colleagues, mentors): "I'm focusing on [niche] and looking for 1–2 leads who [brief description from Target Client]. Do you know anyone who might be a fit?" Offer to make it easy (e.g. "I can send you a one-liner you can forward").
3. **Warm network:** Email or message people who already know you. Same as referrals: brief description of who you help and what you offer, ask for an intro or permission to reach out. "Worth a 15-min call?" is enough.
4. **Volume:** Aim for 5–10 new outreach actions per week (messages, emails, or referral asks). Track in a simple list (name, company, date sent, reply/call/proposal).

**Example outreach (LinkedIn):** "Hi [Name], I help [target client type] with [core offer]. I saw [company] is [relevant observation]. Would a 15-min call to see if we're a fit be useful? [Your name]"

**Example outreach (referral ask):** "I'm looking for 1–2 B2B SaaS marketing leads (10–100 employees) who want to grow organic traffic. Do you know anyone who might be open to a short intro? I can send you a one-liner to forward."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] 5–10 outreach actions sent; [ ] At least one call booked or reply received; [ ] You're tracking who you contacted

## Step 4: Proposal Structure and Close

**Time estimate:** 45–60 minutes per proposal (first one; faster with a template)  
**Purpose:** Send a clear, professional proposal so the prospect can say yes quickly.

### Sub-steps

1. **Structure (1–2 pages):** Summary (who you are, what you do, why you're a fit for them); Scope (deliverables from your package—use [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md)); Investment (price and payment terms—use [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md)); Next step ("Sign contract and we'll schedule kickoff by [date]").
2. **Personalize:** Use their name, company, and one line from discovery or research (e.g. "You mentioned you want to grow organic traffic without more ad spend—our Growth package is built for that.").
3. **Proof:** Add one proof point (case study, result, testimonial) from your [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) or [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) Part 4.
4. **Send and follow up:** Send the proposal (PDF or link). If no reply in 3–5 days, one short follow-up: "Wanted to make sure you saw this—happy to jump on a call if you have questions." Don't chase more than 2–3 times.
5. **Close:** When they say yes, send contract ([Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) or [Systeme.io](systeme-io-setup-guide.md)) and first invoice. Use your [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP) for welcome and kickoff.

**Example proposal outline:**

- **Summary:** We help B2B SaaS grow organic traffic and leads with content strategy and SEO. We're a fit for [Company] because [one reason from research].
- **Scope:** Growth package: 4 blog posts/month, 8 LinkedIn posts/month, strategy doc, monthly report. [Bullet list from Service Package.]
- **Investment:** $2,200/month; 50% upfront, 50% on delivery. Net 15 after that. 3-month minimum.
- **Next step:** Sign the contract and we'll schedule kickoff within 5 days. First deliverable by [date].

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one proposal sent; [ ] Proposal has summary, scope, investment, next step; [ ] You have a follow-up plan and close process (contract + onboarding)
