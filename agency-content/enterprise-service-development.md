# Enterprise Service Development

Guided exercises to define service lines, pricing by tier, delivery playbooks, and positioning for multi-service and premium offerings—supporting $15,000–$50,000+/month at Level 3. **Most detailed** framework in the Agency package: longest "How to use," most granular parts, **3+ worked examples**.

## Purpose

Clear enterprise service development (service lines, pricing, playbooks, positioning) lets you sell and deliver multiple services at scale without chaos. For Level 3 established multi-service agency ($15,000–$50,000+/month, 12–16 weeks, $800–2,000 platform costs), defining what you offer per line, how much you charge, how delivery runs (playbooks), and how you position vs competitors keeps 10+ clients and 5+ people aligned. Without it, every deal is custom and delivery is inconsistent.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 90–120 minutes (longest framework in the package)  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 1 of the [Level 3 Implementation Plan](agency-level-3-plan.md) (Enterprise Positioning and Platforms); align with [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md), [Team Scaling Guide](team-scaling-guide.md), [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md), and [Enterprise Templates](enterprise-templates.zip) (ZIP). Use in proposals, SOWs, and pipeline (service line field).

## Part 1: Service Lines (What You Offer)

### Define each service line (name, scope, ideal client)

**Service line 1 (e.g. Content & SEO):**
- Name: _________________________________________________
- Scope (deliverables, volume, frequency): _________________________________________________
- Ideal client (size, need, budget): _________________________________________________

**Service line 2 (e.g. Paid Media):**
- Name: _________________________________________________
- Scope: _________________________________________________
- Ideal client: _________________________________________________

**Service line 3 (if applicable):**
- Name: _________________________________________________
- Scope: _________________________________________________
- Ideal client: _________________________________________________

**Service line 4 (if applicable):**
- Name: _________________________________________________
- Scope: _________________________________________________
- Ideal client: _________________________________________________

**Example:** "Content & SEO: strategy, blog/SEO, LinkedIn, monthly report. Ideal: B2B, 20–200 employees, $3k–$8k/month. Paid Media: strategy, campaign setup, manage, optimize, monthly report. Ideal: B2B or B2C, $5k–$15k/month. Strategy: discovery, strategy doc, quarterly review. Ideal: enterprise, $10k+ project or retainer."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 2–3 service lines defined; [ ] Scope and ideal client per line; [ ] No overlap that confuses clients (or overlap is intentional bundle)

---

## Part 2: Pricing by Service Line and Tier (Fill-In)

### What you charge per line and per tier (Starter/Growth/Premium or equivalent)

**Service line 1 pricing:**
- Tier 1 (e.g. Foundation): $_________/month (or project $_________)
- Tier 2 (e.g. Core): $_________/month (or project $_________)
- Tier 3 (e.g. Scale): $_________/month (or project $_________)

**Service line 2 pricing:**
- Tier 1: $_________/month (or project $_________)
- Tier 2: $_________/month (or project $_________)
- Tier 3: $_________/month (or project $_________)

**Service line 3 (if applicable):** Same structure.

**Multi-line discount or bundle (if applicable):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Content & SEO: Foundation $2.5k, Core $4.5k, Scale $7k/month. Paid: Foundation $4k, Core $7k, Scale $12k/month. Strategy: project $8k–$15k or retainer $5k/quarter. Bundle: Content + Paid same client 10% off second line."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pricing per line and tier set; [ ] Multi-line or bundle (if any) clear; [ ] Align with [Scaling & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-3-scaling-revenue-strategy.md) margin

## Part 3: Delivery Playbooks (Per Service Line)

### Phases, owners, timelines, handoffs per line

**Service line 1 playbook:**
- Phase 1: _________________________________________________ Owner: _________________________________________________ Timeline: _________________________________________________
- Phase 2: _________________________________________________ Owner: _________________________________________________ Timeline: _________________________________________________
- Phase 3 (ongoing): _________________________________________________ Owner: _________________________________________________ Timeline: _________________________________________________

**Service line 2 playbook:** Same structure.

**Service line 3 (if applicable):** Same structure.

**Handoff from sales to delivery (when deal closes):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Content & SEO: Phase 1 Strategy (2 weeks, Content lead). Phase 2 First content (2 weeks, Content lead). Phase 3 Ongoing + report (monthly, Content lead). Paid: Phase 1 Strategy + setup (2 weeks, Paid lead). Phase 2 Launch (1 week). Phase 3 Optimize + report (monthly). Handoff: Account manager creates kickoff; Delivery lead (per line) runs kickoff and tasks."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Phases, owners, timelines per line; [ ] Handoff from sales to delivery documented; [ ] Align with [Enterprise Operations Framework](enterprise-operations-framework.md) SLAs

## Part 4: Positioning vs Competitors (Multi-Service)

### How you're different and why enterprise clients choose you

**Competitors (who they are, what they charge):**
_________________________________________________

**Our differentiator (one sentence per line or overall):**
_________________________________________________

**Proof (case studies, results, testimonials by line):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Competitors: full-service agencies at $15k–$30k/month; specialists at $5k–$10k. We're different: we offer Content, Paid, and Strategy under one roof with one Account manager so the client doesn't manage three vendors. Proof: 3 case studies Content, 2 Paid, 1 Strategy; enterprise testimonial from [industry]."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Competitors and differentiator clear; [ ] Proof per line (or overall) noted; [ ] Use in [Enterprise Outreach Guide](agency-level-3-enterprise-outreach-guide.md) and proposals
