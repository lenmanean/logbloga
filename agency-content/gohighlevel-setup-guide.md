# GoHighLevel Setup Guide

Step-by-step setup for GoHighLevel so you can run CRM, pipelines, automation, calendar, campaigns, and reporting in one platform—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month with a 2–5 person team (Option A, recommended).

## Overview

**Option A (All-in-One, recommended).** GoHighLevel gives you one platform for CRM, pipelines, automation, calendar, campaigns, and reporting so a 2–5 person team can run 5–10 clients. For Level 2 small team agency ($5,000–$15,000/month, 6–8 weeks, $300–800 platform costs), choosing Option A means one login for the whole team, shared pipelines, and built-in automation. This guide walks you through account and sub-account setup, pipeline and deal stages, team roles and permissions, calendar and booking, campaigns and automation, and reporting.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option A (GoHighLevel, recommended)**. If you prefer **Option B (Best-of-Breed)** with HubSpot paid, ClickUp paid, and Zite, use those guides instead. Do not mix Option A and Option B for the same workflow; pick one path.

## Prerequisites

- Email address and payment method for GoHighLevel plan (agency or similar tier)
- [Level 1 complete or equivalent](agency-level-1-plan.md) (niche, service packages, target client, first clients)
- [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) in progress (roles, handoffs) so you can map users and pipelines
- Optional: [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) for pipeline stages and delivery playbooks

**Time:** About 2–3 hours total (account and pipeline ~45 min; team and calendar ~40 min; campaigns and reporting ~45 min).

## Step 1: Account and Sub-Account Setup

**Time estimate:** 20–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a GoHighLevel account (or agency sub-account) and choose a plan that supports 2–5 users and 5–10 clients.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [gohighlevel.com](https://www.gohighlevel.com) and sign up with your email (or use an existing agency account and create a sub-account for your agency).
2. **Choose a plan:** Compare Starter vs Unlimited vs Agency. For Level 2 (2–5 person team, 5–10 clients, $5k–$15k/month), Unlimited or Agency tier typically includes multiple users, pipelines, automation, calendar, and white-label options. Check user limits and pipeline/contact limits.
3. **Complete billing** and verify your account is active. If you're on an agency plan, create a **sub-account** for your own agency so you have a clean instance for your team and clients.
4. **Verify:** You see the main dashboard with menu items for Pipeline, Contacts, Calendar, Campaigns, Automation, and Reports.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] GoHighLevel account (or sub-account) created; [ ] Plan supports 2+ users and pipelines; [ ] Dashboard accessible

## Step 2: Pipeline and Deal Stages

**Time estimate:** 25–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a sales pipeline with deal stages so the whole team can track leads and clients from first contact to close and delivery.

### Sub-steps

1. In GoHighLevel, go to **Pipeline** (or **Sales**). Create or open your **agency pipeline** (e.g. "Agency Sales" or "Client Pipeline").
2. **Define stages** that match your process. Example: Lead → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Closed won → Onboarded → In delivery → Renewal. Use your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) tiers and [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) handoffs so stages align with who owns each step.
3. **Add stage actions (optional):** Configure actions when a deal moves (e.g. task for account owner when "Proposal sent," or automation when "Closed won"). This keeps the team in sync without manual reminders.
4. **Add a test deal:** Create one contact and one deal; move the deal through two or three stages. Confirm visibility for all team members who should see the pipeline.
5. **Document:** Note where new leads enter (form, manual, import) and how deals are assigned (round-robin, owner, or manual). Align with [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) kickoff and status workflows.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline created with clear stages; [ ] At least one test deal added and moved; [ ] Team can see and update deals (once users are added)

---

## Step 3: Team Roles and Permissions

**Time estimate:** 20–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Add team members and set roles so everyone has the right access (pipelines, contacts, calendar, campaigns) without exposing sensitive data.

### Sub-steps

1. In GoHighLevel, go to **Settings** → **Team** (or **Users**). Invite team members by email. Assign a **role** (e.g. Admin, Manager, Agent) per your [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) roles.
2. **Permissions:** Restrict or allow access to Pipelines, Contacts, Calendar, Campaigns, and Reports as needed. For Level 2, typical setup: owner/manager sees all; delivery leads see their assigned clients; sales sees pipeline and contacts.
3. **Pipeline ownership:** If your plan supports it, set default deal ownership (e.g. round-robin for new leads) or allow manual assignment. Document who owns follow-up at each stage in your internal playbook.
4. **Verify:** Each invited user receives an email and can log in. Confirm they see only what they should (e.g. agents don’t see billing or other sensitive settings).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 2 users invited and roles set; [ ] Permissions match your team structure; [ ] Deal ownership or assignment process clear

## Step 4: Calendar and Booking

**Time estimate:** 20–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up shared or individual calendars and booking links so leads and clients can book calls with the right team member.

### Sub-steps

1. In GoHighLevel, go to **Calendar** (or **Scheduling**). Connect **calendar(s)** for each team member (Google Calendar, Outlook, or GoHighLevel native) so busy times are blocked.
2. **Create booking types:** e.g. "Discovery call (30 min)," "Strategy call (45 min)," "Client review (30 min)." Set duration, buffer, and availability. Assign to the appropriate team member(s) or use a round-robin if multiple people can take the call.
3. **Add short form:** Before booking, collect name, email, company (and optionally source or message) so you have context and can create or update the contact and deal.
4. **Publish booking link(s):** Add to your website, email signature, or campaigns. Test: book a test appointment; confirm the event appears in the correct calendar and the contact/deal is created or updated in CRM.
5. **Sync with pipeline:** When a booking is made, optionally create a deal in "Lead" or "Qualified" and assign the owner. Document this in your [Client Acquisition Scaling Guide](agency-level-2-client-acquisition-scaling-guide.md) so outreach and booking stay aligned.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Calendar(s) connected; [ ] At least one booking type per role (or shared); [ ] Booking creates/updates contact and (optional) deal; [ ] Link works in browser

## Step 5: Campaigns and Automation

**Time estimate:** 25–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Build one or two campaigns (e.g. new lead nurture, client check-in) with automation so the team spends less time on manual follow-up.

### Sub-steps

1. In GoHighLevel, go to **Campaigns** (or **Automation**). Create a new **campaign** (e.g. "New lead nurture").
2. **Trigger:** Set the trigger (e.g. contact added to pipeline, or deal entered stage "Lead"). Use tags or custom fields if you need to segment (e.g. by source or service interest).
3. **Workflow steps:** Add 3–5 steps: e.g. send email 1 (welcome), wait 2 days, send email 2 (case study or offer), wait 2 days, send email 3 ("Book a call" or "Reply if interested"). Optionally add a task for a team member to follow up if no reply.
4. **Emails:** Use templates that match your [Client Acquisition Scaling Guide](agency-level-2-client-acquisition-scaling-guide.md) messaging. Personalize with merge fields (first name, company). Keep tone professional and concise.
5. **Client retention automation (optional):** Create a second campaign for existing clients (e.g. trigger: deal in "In delivery" for 30 days → send check-in email or create task for account manager). Align with [Client Retention Strategies](client-retention-strategies.md).
6. **Test:** Add a test contact or deal that meets the trigger; confirm emails send (or tasks create) as expected. Disable or pause test contacts after verification.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one campaign created with trigger and 3+ steps; [ ] Emails send (or tasks create) in test; [ ] Optional second campaign for client touchpoints

## Step 6: Reporting and Dashboards

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a simple dashboard so you can review pipeline value, deal count by stage, and (if available) revenue or activity.

### Sub-steps

1. In GoHighLevel, go to **Reports** or **Dashboard**. Open the default pipeline report or create a new **dashboard**.
2. **Pipeline metrics:** Add or view pipeline value by stage, number of deals by stage, and won/lost counts. Use this for weekly or monthly team reviews (see [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) meeting cadence).
3. **Activity (optional):** If available, add widgets for calls, emails, or tasks completed so you can see team activity and follow-up consistency.
4. **Export or share:** Ensure the owner or manager can export or share the dashboard with the team. Document where to find it in your [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP) status report or review template.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline report or dashboard visible; [ ] Deal count and value by stage make sense; [ ] Team knows where to find the report
