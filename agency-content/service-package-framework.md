# Service Package Framework

Guided exercises to define service packages (scope, deliverables, pricing) so you don't undercharge or overpromise—supporting $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency.

## Purpose

Clear service packages (scope, deliverables, pricing) set client expectations and protect your time. For Level 1 solo agency ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), defining what you do at what price—with add-ons and boundaries—helps you land clients without undercharging or overpromising. Without it, you'll custom-quote every deal and burn out.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 60–75 minutes  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](agency-level-1-plan.md) after [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md); align with [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md), [Solo Revenue Strategy](agency-level-1-solo-revenue-strategy.md), and [Solo Budget Worksheet](agency-level-1-solo-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to research "agency pricing [niche] monthly retainer" or "service package scope [your offer]"; then set your own based on scope and market.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in proposals, on your website, and in the [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md).

Price: $_________/month (or one-time $_________)  

**Package 2 (e.g. Growth):**  
Scope: _________________________________________________  
Price: $_________/month (or one-time $_________)  

**Package 3 (e.g. Premium or custom):**  
Scope: _________________________________________________  
Price: $_________/month (or one-time $_________)  

**Example:** "Starter: 2 blog posts/month + 4 LinkedIn posts/month + monthly report — $1,200/month. Growth: 4 blog posts/month + 8 LinkedIn posts/month + strategy doc + monthly report — $2,200/month. Premium: Growth + 1 strategy call/month + priority support — $3,200/month."

### What's extra and what's never included

**Add-ons (optional extras with price):**
_________________________________________________

**Boundaries (what's never included; say no or quote separately):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Add-ons: extra blog post +$200; strategy call +$150. Boundaries: no paid ads; no design (provide assets or we use templates); no video; no rush (under 5 days) unless add-on."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Add-ons and prices noted; [ ] Boundaries clear so you don't overpromise

**My positioning (how I'm different):**
_________________________________________________

**Proof points (case study, result, testimonial):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Competitors: generic content agencies at $1,500–$3,000/month. I'm different: B2B-only, 2-week sprints, no long-term lock-in. Proof: 2 case studies (30%+ traffic), 1 testimonial."
