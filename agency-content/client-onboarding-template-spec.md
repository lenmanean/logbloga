## Intended Contents of the ZIP

The Client Onboarding Template (ZIP) is a ready-to-use pack for onboarding new agency clients. It aligns with the [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) and [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) so every new client gets a consistent welcome, discovery, kickoff, and checklist.

### File List and Purpose

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Welcome email template** | Short email sent when the client signs (thank you, what happens next, link to calendar or questionnaire). Personalize with client name and next step (e.g. "Please complete the discovery form by [date]; we'll schedule kickoff once received."). |
| **Discovery questionnaire** | Form or doc with 5–10 questions: goals, audience, key messages, competitors or references, timeline, who approves work. Use answers in kickoff and delivery. Align with [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) (goals, pain points). |
| **Kickoff agenda** | One-page agenda for the kickoff call: intro, review discovery answers, confirm scope and timeline, set first deliverables and dates, Q&A. Use with [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) scope. |
| **Onboarding checklist** | Checklist for you (agency): contract signed, first invoice sent/paid, discovery completed, kickoff held, first deliverables scheduled, client added to CRM/task tool. Use with [Level 1 Implementation Plan](agency-level-1-plan.md) Phase 3 (Client Onboarding Template in use). |

### Alignment with Package Content

- **Target Client Framework:** Discovery questions should capture goals, pain points, and buying context so delivery is aligned. Use the framework's Part 2 (goals and pain points) and Part 1 (demographics/firmographics) to design questions.
- **First Agency Clients Guide:** Welcome email and next steps (discovery → kickoff) should match the guide's "proposal and close" and "onboarding" flow. After close, send welcome + discovery; after discovery, schedule kickoff; after kickoff, start delivery.
- **Service Package Framework:** Kickoff agenda should confirm scope (deliverables, cadence, reporting) from the package the client bought. Checklist should include "Scope confirmed in kickoff."
