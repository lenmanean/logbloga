# Client Retention Strategies

Guided exercises to define health signals, touchpoints, and upsell/renewal so you keep and grow 5–10 clients—supporting $5,000–$15,000/month at Level 2.

## Purpose

Retention (health signals, touchpoints, upsell/renewal) protects revenue and grows account value. For Level 2 small team agency ($5,000–$15,000/month, 6–8 weeks, $300–800 platform costs), defining how you spot at-risk clients, how often you touch base, and how you approach renewal and upsell keeps churn low and revenue predictable. Without it, clients leave quietly or you miss expansion opportunities.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 60–75 minutes  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 2 of the [Level 2 Implementation Plan](agency-level-2-plan.md) (Client Retention and Operations); align with [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) (who owns check-ins and renewals) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) (tiers for upsell). Use in [GoHighLevel](gohighlevel-setup-guide.md) or [HubSpot paid](hubspot-paid-setup.md) for automation and tasks.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft "client health signals agency" or "renewal conversation script"; then customize for your services and tone.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in [Agency Operations Templates](agency-operations-templates.zip) (ZIP), automation, and the [Team & Portfolio Checklist](agency-level-2-team-portfolio-checklist.md).

## Part 1: Health Signals (Fill-In)

### How you know a client is healthy or at risk

**Positive signals (client is engaged and likely to renew):**  
_________________________________________________

**Warning signals (client may churn or reduce scope):**  
_________________________________________________

**Who monitors and how often:**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Positive: on-time feedback, attends calls, asks for more work or referrals. Warning: slow feedback (e.g. >7 days), missed calls, vague or negative feedback, asks about reducing scope or pausing. Account manager monitors; weekly internal standup includes 'client health' for each account."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Positive and warning signals listed; [ ] Owner and frequency set; [ ] Action when warning (e.g. escalate to Owner, schedule check-in)

---

## Part 2: Touchpoints (Fill-In)

### When and how you touch base with clients

**Regular touchpoints (frequency and format):**  
_________________________________________________

**Owner for each:**  
_________________________________________________

**Content (what you cover: status, results, next steps):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Biweekly 15-min call (Account manager): status, blockers, next 2 weeks. Monthly email report: metrics, deliverables done, next month. Quarterly business review (Growth/Premium): results vs goals, roadmap, upsell opportunity. Owner: Account manager for calls and report; Owner joins QBR for Premium."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Frequency and format per tier (if different); [ ] Owner clear; [ ] Content prevents "we never hear from them" complaints

---

## Part 3: Renewal Process (Fill-In)

### When and how you approach renewal

**When you start the renewal conversation (e.g. days before contract end):**  
_________________________________________________

**Who owns:**  
_________________________________________________

**Steps (e.g. check-in call, offer, proposal, close):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Start 45 days before contract end. Account manager owns. Steps: (1) 45-day check-in call: how are we doing, what's next; (2) 30 days: send renewal offer or proposal (same tier or tier change); (3) 14 days: follow-up if no response; (4) Owner closes or negotiates if needed."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Timeline and owner; [ ] Steps clear; [ ] Align with [Team Pricing & Revenue Strategy](agency-level-2-team-pricing-revenue-strategy.md)

---

## Part 4: Upsell and Expansion (Fill-In)

### When and how you offer more (tier upgrade, add-ons)

**Triggers (e.g. client asks for more, results exceed goal, contract anniversary):**  
_________________________________________________

**Who owns:**  
_________________________________________________

**Offer (e.g. tier upgrade, add-on, new service):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Triggers: client asks for more deliverables; results beat goal and they want to scale; QBR and they have budget. Account manager identifies; Owner or Account manager presents. Offer: move Starter to Growth, or add strategy call, or new service line (e.g. ads). Use [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) tiers and add-ons."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Triggers and owner; [ ] Offer ties to service suite; [ ] No hard sell; value-first

## Worked Example 1: Content Agency (5–8 Clients)

**Health:** Positive: on-time feedback, refers others. Warning: 2+ missed calls, feedback "we need to talk about scope." Account manager notes in weekly standup; Owner joins next call if warning.

**Touchpoints:** Biweekly call (Account manager), monthly report (email), quarterly review (Growth/Premium). Content: deliverables done, metrics, next month, blockers.

**Renewal:** 45 days out, Account manager check-in; 30 days send renewal; Owner closes if discount or pushback.

**Upsell:** When client asks for more posts or strategy; Account manager suggests tier upgrade or add-on; Owner approves pricing and closes.

---

## Worked Example 2: Full-Service Marketing Agency (5–10 Clients)

**Health:** Positive: attends all calls, approves on time, asks for new channels. Warning: budget questions, "pause" or "reduce," new stakeholder unhappy. Account manager flags; Owner for at-risk or enterprise.

**Touchpoints:** Biweekly call, monthly report + call for Scale tier. QBR quarterly for Core/Scale: results, roadmap, upsell.

**Renewal:** 60 days out for Scale (longer sales cycle), 45 for others. Account manager runs process; Owner for negotiation and legal.

**Upsell:** Triggers: new channel request, budget increase, QBR. Account manager proposes tier or add-on; Owner closes. Track in pipeline as "Expansion" deal.
