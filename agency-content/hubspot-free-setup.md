# HubSpot Free Setup

Step-by-step setup for HubSpot (free) so you can manage leads and clients with CRM and marketing tools—supporting $2,000–$5,000/month as a solo agency (Option B).

## Overview

**Option B (Best-of-Breed).** HubSpot free gives you CRM and marketing tools for lead and client management. For Level 1 solo agency ($2,000–$5,000/month, 3–4 weeks, $100–300 platform costs), Option B means using HubSpot for CRM and deals, plus [ClickUp free](clickup-free-setup.md) for tasks and delivery and [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup.md) for contracts and invoicing. This guide covers account, contacts and companies, pipeline/deals, basic email templates, and forms or landing page link.

## Which Path

This guide is for **Option B (Best-of-Breed)**. Use it together with [ClickUp Free Setup](clickup-free-setup.md) and [Hello Bonsai Setup](hello-bonsai-setup.md) for the full Option B stack. If you chose **Option A (All-in-One)** with Systeme.io, use the [Systeme.io Setup Guide](systeme-io-setup-guide.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

- Email address for HubSpot sign-up
- [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) and [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) completed or in progress (to define deal stages and outreach)
- Optional: [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md) for messaging

**Time:** About 45–60 minutes total (account and contacts ~15 min; pipeline ~15 min; email and forms ~15–20 min).

## Step 1: Create Account and Set Up Contacts

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a HubSpot account and add your first contacts and companies so you can track leads and clients.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [hubspot.com](https://www.hubspot.com) and sign up for a **free** account (Sales Hub free or CRM free). Use your work email.
2. **Complete onboarding:** Choose "Sales" or "CRM" when asked; skip or simplify other product sign-ups if you only need CRM for now.
3. **Contacts:** Go to **Contacts** → **Contacts**. Add your first contact manually (e.g. a lead or existing client). Fill in: First name, Last name, Email. Optionally add Company, Phone, and a note (e.g. "From LinkedIn").
4. **Companies:** Go to **Contacts** → **Companies**. Create a company and associate the contact with it if you're targeting businesses. Use your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) to decide what fields matter (e.g. Company size, Industry).
5. **Verify:** You can see the contact (and company) in the CRM. You're ready to add more contacts from forms or manually.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] HubSpot account created; [ ] At least one contact and (if relevant) one company added; [ ] You know how to add contacts manually

## Step 2: Pipeline and Deals

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a sales pipeline (deal stages) so you can move leads from first contact to closed won and track revenue.

### Sub-steps

1. In HubSpot, go to **Sales** → **Deals** (or **Pipeline**). Open the default pipeline or create a new one (e.g. "Agency pipeline").
2. **Stages:** Use or edit stages to match your process. Example: Appointment scheduled → Qualified → Proposal sent → Negotiation → Closed won → Closed lost. For Level 1, 5–7 stages are enough. Align with your [First Agency Clients Guide](agency-level-1-first-clients-guide.md) (proposal, close).
3. **Create a test deal:** Create a deal, associate it with a contact (and company), and set the stage. Add a deal value (e.g. from your [Service Package Framework](service-package-framework.md) package price).
4. **Move the deal:** Change the stage to "Proposal sent" or "Closed won" so you see how the pipeline works. Optionally set "Closed won" to trigger a task or notification for onboarding (see [Client Onboarding Template](client-onboarding-template.zip) (ZIP)).
5. **Reporting:** Glance at the pipeline view so you know where each deal stands. For Level 1, manual updates are fine; automation can come later.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline and stages set; [ ] At least one test deal created and moved; [ ] You know how to create and move deals when leads come in

## Step 3: Basic Email Templates

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create 1–2 email templates so you can send consistent outreach and follow-up without retyping.

### Sub-steps

1. In HubSpot, go to **Sales** → **Templates** (or **Email** → **Templates**). Create a new template.
2. **Template 1 — Outreach:** Write a short outreach email (2–4 sentences): who you are, what you do (from your [Agency Niche Framework](agency-niche-framework.md)), why you're reaching out, and one clear ask (e.g. "Worth a 15-min call?"). Use merge fields (e.g. First name) so each email is personalized.
3. **Template 2 — Follow-up:** Write a follow-up email (1–2 sentences): reference your first message, add one more value point or case study, and ask again for a call or reply. Use merge fields.
4. **Save and test:** Save both templates. Send a test to yourself; confirm merge fields work and the email looks professional.
5. **Use in sequences (optional):** If HubSpot free includes 1:1 email sequences, create a 2–3 email sequence using these templates for new leads. Otherwise, use templates manually when you email from the contact record.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one outreach and one follow-up template created; [ ] Merge fields (e.g. First name) work; [ ] You can send from contact record or sequence

## Step 4: Forms or Landing Page Link

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Capture leads via a form or link so you can add them to your CRM and pipeline.

### Sub-steps

1. In HubSpot, go to **Marketing** → **Lead Capture** → **Forms** (or **Forms** in the main menu). Create a new form.
2. **Form fields:** Add First name, Last name, Email. Optionally add Company, Phone, or Message. Keep it short (3–5 fields) to increase submissions. Use your [Target Client Framework](target-client-framework.md) to decide what you need to qualify leads.
3. **Form options:** Choose "Create new contact" when the form is submitted. Optionally add a contact to a list or set a lifecycle stage (e.g. "Lead"). If you have a deal pipeline, you can create a deal and set the stage (e.g. "Lead") via automation or do it manually.
4. **Embed or link:** Embed the form on your website, or use HubSpot's hosted form link and share it (e.g. in LinkedIn, email signature). Test by submitting the form yourself; confirm the contact appears in CRM and (if set) the deal is created.
5. **Landing page (optional):** If HubSpot free includes a simple landing page builder, create one page with the form and a short headline/value prop (from your niche and target client). Use the page URL in outreach or ads.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one form created; [ ] Form creates contact (and optionally deal) on submit; [ ] Form embedded or link shared; [ ] Test submission works
