# Team & Portfolio Checklist

How to build and use case studies and portfolio so your 2–5 person team can win more proposals and position at $5,000–$15,000/month (Level 2).

## Overview

Case studies and portfolio prove you can deliver and justify premium pricing. This guide covers what to include in case studies (results, client type, scope), where to host them (website, PDF, proposal), and how to use them in proposals and outreach. Time investment: 6–8 weeks; expected revenue $5,000–$15,000/month when you have 5–10 clients and 2–5 strong case studies. Use with [Client Acquisition Scaling Guide](agency-level-2-client-acquisition-scaling-guide.md) for pipeline and proposals.

## Why Case Studies and Portfolio Matter

At Level 2 you're competing with other agencies. Buyers want proof: "Who have you worked with? What results did you get?" Case studies (client, scope, results) and a clear portfolio (where to find them, how to use them in proposals) turn your delivery into sales assets so you close more and charge more.

## Step 1: What to Include in a Case Study

**Time estimate:** 45–60 minutes per case study (first 2–3; faster with a template)  
**Purpose:** Each case study should answer: who was the client, what did you do, what were the results, and why does it matter to the prospect.

### Sub-steps

1. **Client and context (anonymized if needed).** "B2B SaaS, 50 employees, marketing team of 2." Or "Professional services firm, 20 partners, needed content for LinkedIn and blog." No need to name the client unless they've agreed; "B2B SaaS" or "Professional services" is enough.
2. **Scope (what you did).** Align with your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) tiers: e.g. "Content strategy + 4 blog posts/month + 8 LinkedIn posts/month + monthly report." One sentence or a short bullet list.
3. **Results (quantified when possible).** "30% increase in organic traffic in 6 months." "2x LinkedIn engagement in 3 months." "Generated 15 leads from content in Q1." If you don't have numbers, use outcomes: "Established thought leadership; client quoted in [publication]."
4. **Proof (testimonial or quote).** One sentence from the client: "They understood our space and delivered on time." Ask for permission to use name and company or "Anonymous, B2B SaaS."
5. **Format.** One page per case study (PDF or web page): headline, client type, scope, results, quote, optional logo or "Case study" label.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 2–3 case studies with client type, scope, results; [ ] At least 1 with a testimonial; [ ] Format consistent (one page each)

## Step 2: Where to Host Case Studies

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to set up; 15 min per new case study  
**Purpose:** Prospects and your team need one place to find case studies so you can link or attach them in proposals and outreach.

### Sub-steps

1. **Website (preferred).** Create a "Case studies" or "Work" page on your agency website. One section or card per case study with headline, client type, results (1–2 lines), and "Read more" link or expandable section. Keep it simple; 3–5 case studies is enough to start.
2. **PDF pack (optional).** If you don't have a website yet, create a single PDF with 2–5 one-page case studies. Send as an attachment in proposals or after a discovery call. Name it clearly (e.g. "AgencyCaseStudies_2025.pdf").
3. **Proposal embed.** In your proposal (PDF or doc), include 1–2 relevant case studies (same industry or same tier). "Similar client: [headline]. Results: [one line]. Full case study: [link or attached]."
4. **Internal.** Store master copies (with client names if confidential) in a shared folder or [ClickUp](clickup-paid-setup.md) so the team can pull the right case study for each proposal. Document in [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) who updates case studies (e.g. Account manager or Owner).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Case studies live on website or in PDF pack; [ ] Team knows where to find them; [ ] At least one used in a recent proposal

## Step 3: How to Use Case Studies in Proposals

**Time estimate:** 5–10 minutes per proposal  
**Purpose:** Match the right case study to the prospect so they see "this agency has done this for someone like me."

### Sub-steps

1. **Match by client type or tier.** If the prospect is B2B SaaS, use a B2B SaaS case study. If they're looking at your Growth tier, use a Growth-tier case study (scope and results). Don't use a Premium case study for a Starter-fit prospect unless it shows range.
2. **One paragraph in the proposal.** "We've helped similar clients achieve [result]. Example: [Client type] — [scope] — [result]. [Link or 'Full case study attached']. We'd bring the same approach to [prospect company]."
3. **After the call.** Send 1–2 case studies by email after the discovery call: "As discussed, here are two examples relevant to [their situation]. Happy to answer questions."
4. **Track.** Note which case studies you used in which proposals and whether they closed. Double down on the ones that resonate (e.g. by industry or tier).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] You match case study to prospect; [ ] At least one case study in every proposal; [ ] You track which ones you use and close rates (optional)

## Step 4: Team Visibility (Who Is in the Portfolio)

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes to document  
**Purpose:** Buyers often want to know who will work on their account. Make the team visible so prospects can see roles and expertise.

### Sub-steps

1. **Team page or section.** On your website or in your proposal, add a short "Team" section: name, role, one line (e.g. "Lead strategy and client success"). Use [Team Management Framework](team-management-framework.md) roles (Owner, Delivery lead, Account manager, Specialist). No need for long bios; 1–2 sentences each.
2. **Who will work on their account.** In the proposal, say who will be their main contact (e.g. Account manager) and who will lead delivery (Delivery lead). "You'll work with [Name] for strategy and check-ins, and [Name] for day-to-day delivery."
3. **Case study ownership.** When you write a case study, credit the team (e.g. "Delivery lead: [Name]. Account manager: [Name].") if the client is okay with it. This reinforces that you have a team, not just one person.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Team visible on website or in proposal; [ ] Prospect knows who their main contact and delivery lead will be; [ ] Case studies optionally credit team

## Step 5: Maintenance (When to Add or Update)

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes per quarter  
**Purpose:** Keep case studies current so they reflect your best work and current tiers.

### Sub-steps

1. **Add a new case study** when you complete a project or engagement with clear results (every 2–4 clients). Use the template from Step 1. Get client sign-off if you use their name or logo.
2. **Update old case studies** if the scope or tier has changed (e.g. you no longer offer that package). Archive or remove outdated ones so you don't promise something you've discontinued.
3. **Review quarterly.** In your pipeline or team meeting, review: Do we have a case study for each tier? For each main industry we target? Fill gaps over the next quarter.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 2–3 case studies current; [ ] One case study per tier (if you have 3 tiers); [ ] Quarterly review scheduled
