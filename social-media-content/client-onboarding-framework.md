# Client Onboarding Framework

Guided exercises to onboard SMM clients cleanly so you can deliver consistently and reach $1,000–$3,000/month.

## Purpose

A clear onboarding process (kickoff, brand and guidelines, content calendar setup, reporting cadence) sets expectations and avoids scope creep. For Level 2 SMM, onboarding clients cleanly helps you manage 3–5 clients without confusion. Without it, you'll miss access, brand details, or reporting expectations and waste time fixing issues later.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes per client (first onboarding)  
- **When:** Use for every new SMM client (Phase 2 of the [Implementation Plan](social-media-level-2-plan.md)); before creating or scheduling content.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft a kickoff email or discovery questions from your fill-ins; then personalize per client.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers with the [Client Onboarding Checklist](client-onboarding-checklist.pdf) (PDF), [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template.xlsx) (XLSX), and [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) (DOCX) from the Templates section.

## Part 1: Kickoff (Discovery, Goals, Access)

### Get on the same page and get access

**Client name and contact:**
_________________________________________________

**Discovery questions (what you asked or will ask):**
- Goals for social (e.g. awareness, leads, sales): _________________________________________________
- Target audience: _________________________________________________
- Key messages or brand pillars: _________________________________________________
- Competitors or references (who they like): _________________________________________________
- Timeline (launch date, first report date): _________________________________________________

**Access received (check when done):**
- [ ] Social account login or Business Manager access (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)
- [ ] Brand assets (logo, colors, fonts) or link to brand guide
- [ ] Content approval process (who approves, how fast)

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Discovery call or form completed; [ ] Goals and timeline clear; [ ] Access received and documented

## Part 2: Brand and Guidelines

### Document brand voice and visual so content is on-brand

**Brand voice and tone (e.g. professional, friendly, bold):**
_________________________________________________

**Colors and fonts (or link to brand guide):**
_________________________________________________

**Do's and don'ts (e.g. no politics, no competitor mentions):**
_________________________________________________

**Hashtags or handles to use/avoid:**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Voice: professional but approachable. Colors: #1E3A5F (navy), #F5A623 (gold). Don'ts: no politics, no competitor names. Use #BrandName and @BrandHandle."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Brand and guidelines documented; [ ] Shared with client for confirmation; [ ] Used in first content batch

## Part 3: Content Calendar Setup

### Set cadence, pillars, and first week

**Cadence (posts per week per platform):**
_________________________________________________

**Content pillars (3–5 themes for this client):**
_________________________________________________

**First week planned (use Content Calendar Template):**
- [ ] Dates and platforms set
- [ ] Content type and copy ideas noted
- [ ] First batch added to [Later](later-setup-guide.md) or [Buffer](buffer-paid-setup-guide.md)

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Cadence and pillars agreed; [ ] First week in Content Calendar Template; [ ] First batch scheduled in Later or Buffer

---

## Part 4: Reporting Cadence

### When and how you'll report

**Reporting frequency (e.g. monthly, bi-weekly):**
_________________________________________________

**Report format (e.g. PDF from [Metricool](metricool-setup-guide.md), plus narrative from Client Reporting Template):**
_________________________________________________

**Report date (e.g. 5th of each month):**
_________________________________________________

**Who receives the report (email or link):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Monthly report by the 5th. PDF from Metricool (metrics, top posts) + 1-page summary from Client Reporting Template (summary, recommendations). Sent to client@company.com."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Reporting cadence set; [ ] First report date on calendar; [ ] Client confirmed
