# Service Pricing Strategy (Level 2)

How to scale SMM pricing so you can reach $1,000–$3,000/month and beyond.

## Purpose

This guide helps you decide when to raise rates, how to communicate changes to clients, and how to evolve packages (Basic/Standard/Premium or custom) so you grow revenue without losing good clients. Use it with the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) and the [SMM Budget Planner](social-media-level-2-smm-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section so your pricing and budget stay aligned.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 20–30 minutes to plan; then review quarterly or when capacity is full.  
- **When:** Use with the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) (packages and pricing) and the [SMM Budget Planner](social-media-level-2-smm-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section.  
- **Cross-ref:** Use in proposals and when renewing or onboarding new clients.

Complete each part below. Use the results when you set new client rates and when you communicate changes to existing clients.

## Part 1: When to Raise for New Clients

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Define when you'll raise rates for new clients so you don't underprice as you add clients.

### Sub-steps

**When to raise for new clients:**  
[ ] Capacity is 80%+ full (e.g. 3 clients, 20 posts/week)  
[ ] I've completed X months with strong results: _________  
[ ] Market rates have increased or my results justify premium  
[ ] My case studies and testimonials support higher pricing  

**How much to raise (e.g. 10–20%):**  
_________________________________________________

**New rate range (e.g. $700–$1,000/month):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "I'll raise for new clients when I have 3 clients and 2+ case studies. I'll raise 15%. New range: $800–$1,100/month for 2 channels, 5+3 posts/week."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] When to raise defined; [ ] New rate range set; [ ] First new client at new rate (when applicable)

## Part 2: How to Communicate Rate Changes to Existing Clients

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Communicate rate changes clearly so existing clients understand and (where appropriate) accept.

### Sub-steps

**When to raise for existing clients:**  
[ ] At contract renewal or new term  
[ ] After 6–12 months of consistent work  
[ ] When I'm adding value (e.g. new channel, extra report)  

**How to communicate:**  
1. Give advance notice (e.g. 30 days before renewal or next term).  
2. State the new rate and effective date.  
3. Offer value in exchange (e.g. "I'm raising my rate to $X/month. In return, you'll get [extra post / strategy call / etc.]").  
4. Use a short email or call; don't over-explain.  

**Rate-change script (copy and customize):**  
"Hi [Client], I'm updating my rates effective [date]. For our work together, my new rate will be [X]/month. I'm also [adding value, e.g. adding a monthly strategy call]. If you have questions, let's chat."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Communication script ready; [ ] First rate change communicated (when applicable)

## Part 3: Package Evolution

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Evolve packages over time so you offer more value and capture more revenue.

### Sub-steps

**Current packages (from Service Pricing Framework):**  
_________________________________________________

**Next evolution (e.g. add Premium tier, add ads management):**  
_________________________________________________

**When to add (e.g. when I have 3 clients and capacity for 1 more):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Current: Basic $600, Standard $850, Premium $1,200. Next: add Ads Management add-on $200/month. When: when 2 clients ask for ads."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Current packages documented; [ ] Next evolution planned; [ ] SMM Budget Planner updated with new revenue targets
