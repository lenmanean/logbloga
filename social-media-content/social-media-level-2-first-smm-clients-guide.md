# First SMM Clients Guide (Level 2)

How to land your first social media management clients so you can reach $1,000–$3,000/month.

## Overview

Landing your first SMM clients means identifying who to target, defining your offer (packages), reaching out (LinkedIn, referrals), and closing with a proposal and contract. For Level 2, aim for 1–3 clients within 4–6 weeks so you can fill capacity and reach $1,000–$3,000/month. This guide covers who to target, your offer (packages), outreach (LinkedIn, referrals), and proposal and close—within Level 2 time investment and platform costs ($30–100/month).

## Prerequisites

- [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) completed (packages and pricing)
- [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) completed (onboarding process)
- [Service Portfolio Checklist](social-media-level-2-service-portfolio-checklist.md) in progress (case studies or portfolio)
- Optional: [First Monetization Guide](social-media-level-1-first-monetization-guide.md) experience (personal brand results as first case studies)

## Step 1: Who to Target

**Time:** ~20–30 minutes to define  
**Purpose:** Identify ideal SMM clients so your outreach and offer fit.

### Sub-steps

1. **Industry or niche:** Who needs SMM but doesn't have in-house? E.g. small businesses, local services, coaches, e-commerce, B2B. Pick 1–2 industries to start so your messaging is focused.
2. **Size and budget:** Small business (1–10 employees), solopreneur, or micro-business. Budget: $500–$1,200/month for SMM is typical for Level 2. Don't target enterprises yet (they need more proof and process).
3. **Where they are:** LinkedIn (decision-makers), referrals (past clients or network), local business groups, or industry communities. List 2–3 channels you'll use for outreach.
4. **Red flags:** Who to avoid? E.g. "I need 10 posts per day for $200/month," or no brand assets, or unclear goals. Define 2–3 red flags so you don't waste time.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Ideal client (industry, size, budget) defined; [ ] 2–3 outreach channels chosen; [ ] Red flags listed

## Step 2: Offer (Packages)

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes (if not already done in Service Pricing Framework)  
**Purpose:** Present clear packages so prospects know what they're buying.

### Sub-steps

1. **Use your [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md):** Pull your 1–3 packages (Basic/Standard/Premium or custom). Each package: scope (channels, posts/week, reporting), price/month, what's included and what's add-on.
2. **One-page offer:** Create a simple one-pager or proposal section: Package name, what's included (bullets), price, contract terms (e.g. month-to-month, 30-day notice). Use this in proposals and in outreach (e.g. "I offer 3 packages from $600–$1,200/month; here's what's included").
3. **Differentiator:** One sentence on why you (e.g. "I focus on [niche] so content is on-brand and drives [outcome]"). Use this in outreach and proposals.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Packages documented; [ ] One-page offer or proposal section ready; [ ] Differentiator clear

## Step 3: Outreach (LinkedIn, Referrals)

**Time:** ~30–45 minutes to start; ongoing  
**Purpose:** Reach out to 5–10 prospects per week so you get meetings and proposals.

### Sub-step 3.1: LinkedIn

1. **Profile:** Your LinkedIn should say you offer SMM (headline, summary, experience). Add 1–2 case studies or results (from Level 1 personal brand or first clients).
2. **Search:** Find decision-makers in your target industry (e.g. "Marketing Manager," "Owner," "Founder" at small businesses). Filter by industry and size if possible.
3. **Connection + message:** Send a connection request with a short note (e.g. "I help [niche] businesses with social media—would love to connect"). If they accept, send a follow-up (e.g. "I offer SMM for [niche]—3 packages from $X–$Y/month. Would a 15-min call make sense to see if we're a fit?"). **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft 2–3 connection and follow-up messages; personalize per prospect.
4. **Volume:** Aim for 5–10 new connections per week and 2–3 follow-ups per week. Not everyone will reply; consistency matters.

### Sub-step 3.2: Referrals

1. **Ask past clients or network:** If you have past clients (Level 1, freelancing, or other), ask: "Do you know anyone who needs social media management? I'm looking for 1–2 more clients in [niche]."
2. **Offer incentive (optional):** E.g. "If they sign, I'll give you [one free month / referral fee]." Keep it simple.
3. **Make it easy:** Send a one-line they can forward: "I work with [name] for social media—she/he does [brief offer]. Want an intro?"

**Testing checklist:** [ ] LinkedIn profile updated; [ ] 5–10 connection requests sent; [ ] 2–3 referrals asked (if applicable)

## Step 4: Proposal and Close

**Time:** ~45–60 minutes per prospect  
**Purpose:** Send a clear proposal and get to a signed agreement.

### Sub-steps

1. **Discovery call:** Before proposing, have a 15–20 min call: goals, current social, budget, timeline. Use this to tailor your proposal (which package, any add-ons).
2. **Proposal:** Send a 1–2 page proposal: situation (what you heard), approach (what you'll do), scope (package + what's included), timeline (start date, first report), investment (price/month), next step (e.g. "Sign the agreement and I'll send onboarding details by [date]"). **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft proposal sections; personalize with client name and goals.
3. **Contract:** Use a simple service agreement (scope, fee, payment terms, length, termination). You can use Hello Bonsai, a template, or a lawyer-drafted one. Get it signed before starting.
4. **Close:** Send proposal + contract. Follow up in 3–5 days if no response. If they say no, ask for feedback and move on.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one discovery call completed; [ ] At least one proposal sent; [ ] Contract template ready; [ ] First client signed (when you get one)
