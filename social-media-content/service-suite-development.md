# Service Suite Development

Guided exercises to define and sell a clear service suite so you can scale to $3,000–$10,000+/month.

## Purpose

A clear service suite (tiers, pricing, positioning, sales and onboarding flow) helps you sell consistently and avoid scope creep. For Level 3, defining what you offer at what price and how you position vs competitors supports agency growth. Without it, you'll custom-quote every deal, underprice, or overpromise.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes  
- **When:** Use in Phase 2 of the [Implementation Plan](social-media-level-3-plan.md) after [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md); align with [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md) and [Team Management Templates](team-management-templates.zip) (ZIP).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft package descriptions or "what's included" bullets from your fill-ins; then personalize per client.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in proposals, on your website, and in the [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md).

## Part 1: Service Tiers (Fill-In)

### What you offer at each level

**Tier 1 (e.g. Essential or Starter):**
- Scope (channels, posts, reporting): _________________________________________________
- Price: $_________/month (or range)
- Ideal client: _________________________________________________

**Tier 2 (e.g. Growth or Standard):**
- Scope: _________________________________________________
- Price: $_________/month (or range)
- Ideal client: _________________________________________________

**Tier 3 (e.g. Scale or Premium):**
- Scope: _________________________________________________
- Price: $_________/month (or range)
- Ideal client: _________________________________________________

**Add-ons (e.g. ads, extra channels, strategy call):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Essential: 1–2 channels, 5 posts/week, monthly report — $800/month. Growth: 2–3 channels, 5+5 posts/week, monthly report + 1 strategy call — $1,400/month. Scale: 3+ channels, full content + ads support, monthly report + 2 calls — $2,500/month. Add-ons: ads management 15% of spend; extra channel +$200/month."

## Part 2: Pricing and Packaging

### How you package and present price

**Retainer vs project:** _________________________________________________ (e.g. monthly retainer only; or retainer + project for launches)

**Minimum commitment (e.g. 3 months, 6 months):**
_________________________________________________

**How you present price (e.g. monthly, quarterly, annual discount):**
_________________________________________________

**Payment terms (e.g. net 15, upfront monthly):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Retainer only; 3-month minimum. Price shown monthly; 10% discount if paid quarterly. Payment net 15."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Packaging and terms documented; [ ] Consistent in proposals and contracts

## Part 3: Positioning vs Competitors

### How you're different and why clients choose you

**Competitors (who they are and what they charge):**
_________________________________________________

**Your differentiators (e.g. niche, reporting, speed, team):**
_________________________________________________

**Proof points (e.g. case studies, results, testimonials):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Competitors: generic SMM agencies at $500–$1,500/month. We focus on B2B and professional services; we offer custom dashboards and monthly strategy call. Proof: 3 case studies with 20–40% engagement lift; 2 testimonials on site."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Positioning and proof points documented; [ ] Used in [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md) and proposals

## Part 4: Sales and Onboarding Flow

### From first contact to first report

**First contact (e.g. form, referral, LinkedIn):**
_________________________________________________

**Discovery (e.g. call, questionnaire):**
_________________________________________________

**Proposal (e.g. 1-pager, scope + investment + terms):**
_________________________________________________

**Close and contract (e.g. e-sign, deposit):**
_________________________________________________

**Onboarding (e.g. kickoff, access, first content, first report date):**
_________________________________________________
(See [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) Part 2 and [Client Onboarding Checklist](client-onboarding-checklist.pdf).)

**Example:** "Contact: website form + referrals. Discovery: 30-min call + short questionnaire. Proposal: 1-pager with scope, deliverables, investment, 3-month minimum. Close: e-sign + first month upfront. Onboarding: kickoff within 5 days; access and brand in 7 days; first report in 30 days."
