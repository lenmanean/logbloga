# Service Portfolio Checklist (Level 2)

A checklist for what to show in your SMM portfolio and where to host it so you can win clients and reach $1,000–$3,000/month.

## Purpose

A clear portfolio (case studies, results, testimonials) helps prospects see what you deliver and trust you with their social. For Level 2, you need at least 1–3 case studies (from personal brand or first clients) and a place to host them (LinkedIn, simple page, or PDF). This checklist helps you decide what to show, where to host, and how to use it in proposals.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes to build; then update as you add clients.  
- **When:** Use before or alongside the [First SMM Clients Guide](social-media-level-2-first-smm-clients-guide.md); update after each new client or campaign.  
- **Cross-ref:** Use with the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) (what you deliver) and [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) (what you charge).

## Step 1: What to Show (Case Studies, Results)

**Time:** ~30–45 minutes  
**Purpose:** Define 1–3 case studies so prospects see proof.

### Sub-steps

1. **Case study 1 (and 2–3):** For each, note: **Client or context** (e.g. "Personal brand – productivity niche" if no client yet), **Goal** (e.g. grow reach, drive link clicks), **What you did** (e.g. 5 posts/week, 3 pillars, monthly reports), **Result** (e.g. "Reach +40% in 3 months," "500 link clicks in 1 month"). Add **testimonial** if available.
2. **Screenshots or links:** If you have client permission, add 1–2 screenshots (top posts, analytics) or links to live content. If you only have personal brand results, use those (e.g. "Grew my own Instagram to X followers in Y months").
3. **Numbers:** Where you can, add metrics (followers, reach, engagement rate, clicks, sales). Numbers build trust.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 1 case study written (client or personal brand); [ ] Results and (if any) testimonials noted; [ ] Screenshots or links ready (with permission)

## Step 2: Where to Host

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Put your portfolio where prospects can find it.

### Sub-steps

1. **LinkedIn:** Add a "Featured" section with your case studies (text + image or link). Or add a link to a simple portfolio page. Many SMM clients are found on LinkedIn, so your profile is your first portfolio.
2. **Simple page:** If you have a website, add a "Work" or "Case Studies" page with 1–3 case studies. If not, a one-page site (Carrd, Notion, Google Doc with link) is enough for Level 2.
3. **PDF (optional):** Create a 1–2 page PDF with case studies and package summary. Attach to proposals or send when prospects ask for "more info."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Portfolio on LinkedIn and/or simple page; [ ] Link ready for proposals and outreach

## Step 3: How to Use in Proposals

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Reference your portfolio in every proposal so prospects see proof.

### Sub-steps

1. **In proposal:** Add a short "Why work with me" or "Results" section: 1–2 sentences per case study + key metric. E.g. "For [client/personal brand], I grew reach by 40% in 3 months with consistent content and monthly optimization."
2. **Link:** Include a link to your full portfolio (LinkedIn featured, page, or PDF) so they can dig deeper.
3. **Testimonial:** If you have a testimonial, add one quote in the proposal. It builds trust.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Proposal includes results section; [ ] Portfolio link in every proposal; [ ] Testimonial used if available

## What You'll Have When Done

At least 1 case study (client or personal brand), a place to host it (LinkedIn and/or page or PDF), and a habit of using it in proposals. Use the [First SMM Clients Guide](social-media-level-2-first-smm-clients-guide.md) for outreach and close, and the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) when you land a client.
