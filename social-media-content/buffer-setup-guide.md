# Buffer Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for setting up Buffer so you can schedule posts and keep a consistent content presence—supporting $300–$1,000/month as a personal brand or content creator.

## Overview

Buffer lets you schedule posts to multiple social accounts from one place. For Level 1 personal brand monetization, a consistent posting schedule helps you grow reach and engagement without posting manually every day. This guide walks you through sign-up, connecting social accounts, creating a queue, choosing post types and best times—within Level 1 time investment (2–3 weeks) and platform costs ($0–30/month). Buffer has a free tier; paid tiers add more channels and posts.

## Prerequisites

- Email address (or social login)
- At least one social account (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or Pinterest) where you'll post
- Content direction or pillars (use the [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) in this level if needed)
- Optional: ChatGPT or Claude for caption drafts

**Time:** About 20–30 minutes total (sign-up and connect ~10 min; queue and first posts ~15–20 min).

## Step 1: Sign Up and Connect Social Accounts

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a Buffer account and connect the social account(s) you'll post to so you can schedule content.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [buffer.com](https://buffer.com) and click **Get Started** or **Sign Up**.
2. Sign up with **email** or **social login** (e.g. Google, Facebook). Use an email you check regularly—Buffer sends scheduling and performance notifications.
3. Choose your **plan** (Free tier is fine for Level 1: one or two connected channels, limited posts per month). You can upgrade later if you add more channels or need more queued posts.
4. **Connect your social account(s):** Click **Add Channel** and follow the prompts to connect Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or Pinterest. You may need to log in to that platform and authorize Buffer. Connect at least one channel to start.
5. **Verify:** After connecting, post a test or check that the channel appears in your Buffer dashboard. If a channel fails to connect, check platform permissions (e.g. Instagram may require a Business or Creator account for some features).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Buffer account created; [ ] At least one social account connected; [ ] Channel visible in dashboard

## Step 2: Create a Queue and Set Best Times

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a queue so Buffer can suggest when to post and you can add posts in batches.

### Sub-step 2.1: Create a queue

1. In Buffer, go to **Queue** (or **Publishing** > **Queue**).
2. Create a **queue** for each connected channel (or use a single queue if you have one channel). Name it clearly (e.g. "Instagram – [your handle]").
3. **Queue settings:** Choose how many posts per day or week you want (e.g. 1 post/day for Level 1). Buffer will suggest time slots based on when your audience is most active (if you have data) or default times.

### Sub-step 2.2: Set best times (optional)

1. If Buffer shows **Best Time to Post** or **Optimal Times**, use those slots for your queue. If not, choose 1–2 times per day that you know your audience is online (e.g. morning and evening).
2. **Consistency matters more than perfection:** For Level 1, pick 3–5 slots per week and stick to them. You can refine later with analytics.

### Sub-step 2.3: Add your first posts to the queue

1. Click **Create Post** (or **Add to Queue**). Write or paste your caption; attach image or video if the platform supports it.
2. Select the **channel(s)** and choose **Add to Queue** (Buffer will assign the next available slot) or pick a specific date/time.
3. Add 3–5 posts to fill your first week. Use the [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) and Content Strategy Template (XLSX) for ideas. **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft 3–5 captions for your pillars; then paste into Buffer and add your visuals.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Queue created; [ ] Best times or default times set; [ ] At least 3 posts in the queue

---

## Step 3: Post Types and Workflow

**Time:** ~5–10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Establish a simple workflow so you know what to add to the queue each week.

### Sub-steps

1. **Post types:** Decide what you'll queue (e.g. carousels, reels, single images, links). Match this to your [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) formats (reels, carousels, stories, etc.). Note: Stories and some formats may need to be posted natively; use Buffer for feed posts where possible.
2. **Workflow:** Block 30–60 minutes once or twice a week to create content (e.g. in Canva), then add captions and media to Buffer. Use the [Daily Posting Checklist](daily-posting-checklist.pdf) (PDF) from the Templates section for morning check, content batch, scheduling, and engagement.
3. **Engagement:** Buffer schedules posts; you still need to reply to comments and DMs on each platform. Set a daily 10–15 min block for engagement.

**What you'll have when done:** A Buffer account with at least one connected channel, a queue with best times (or defaults), and a workflow to add posts weekly. Use the [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) and [Daily Posting Checklist](daily-posting-checklist.pdf) (PDF) to stay consistent.
