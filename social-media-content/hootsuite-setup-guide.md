# Hootsuite Setup Guide

Step-by-step setup for Hootsuite so you can run agency workflows, streams per client, bulk scheduling, and team approval.

## Overview

This guide helps agency leads (Level 3, $3,000–$10,000+/month) set up Hootsuite for multi-client scheduling, streams, approval workflows, and reporting. Hootsuite supports agency-level volume and team collaboration. Platform costs for Level 3 are in the $100–300/month range; Hootsuite is typically part of that stack.

**Why for agency:** Consistency at scale, streams per client, bulk scheduling, and approval workflows so you can deliver for multiple clients with a lean team.

## Prerequisites

- **Level 2 complete or equivalent** (SMM clients, Later/Metricool/Buffer experience)
- **Social accounts** (yours or client access) for the profiles you'll manage
- **Agency or team plan** in mind (solo or with contractors)

## Step 1: Create Account and Choose Plan

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes

1. Go to [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/) and sign up (or log in).
2. Choose a plan that supports multiple profiles and team members (e.g. Professional or Team). Compare profiles, users, and bulk scheduling limits.
3. Complete billing and account setup. Ensure the plan supports the number of social profiles and users you need.

**What you'll have:** Hootsuite account and plan that fits your client count and team size.

## Step 2: Connect Social Profiles

**Time estimate:** 15–25 minutes

1. In the dashboard, go to **Streams** or **Settings** → **Social Networks**.
2. **Add social accounts:** Connect each profile (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, etc.) you manage. Use "Add social network" and follow the platform’s authorization flow.
3. **Organize by client:** If Hootsuite supports teams or labels, group profiles by client so streams and reports stay client-specific. Name profiles clearly (e.g. "Client A – Instagram").
4. **Verify:** Post a test or check that each profile shows in your dashboard and can receive scheduled posts.

**What you'll have:** All relevant social profiles connected and organized by client where possible.

## Step 3: Set Up Streams per Client

**Time estimate:** 20–30 minutes

1. **Create streams:** For each client (or key profile), create a stream that shows that profile’s feed, mentions, messages, or scheduled queue. Use the stream builder and select the right profile and stream type.
2. **Layout:** Arrange streams so you can monitor multiple clients at a glance (e.g. columns per client or per platform).
3. **Filters:** Use filters (e.g. by keyword, mention type) to focus on what matters per client.

**What you'll have:** Streams configured so you can monitor and respond per client without switching tools.

## Step 4: Approval Workflow and Bulk Scheduling

**Time estimate:** 15–25 minutes

1. **Approval (if needed):** If clients or leads must approve posts, enable approval workflow. Assign approvers and set rules (e.g. all posts need approval, or only certain clients). Document in your [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md).
2. **Bulk scheduling:** Use Hootsuite’s bulk composer or calendar to schedule multiple posts at once. Upload or paste content in the required format (e.g. CSV). Map columns to date, time, platform, copy, and asset.
3. **Best times:** Use Hootsuite’s suggestions or your [Advanced Analytics](advanced-analytics-setup.md) data to set optimal send times per platform and client.

**What you'll have:** Approval workflow (if used) and bulk scheduling in place so you can scale content delivery.

## Step 5: Reporting and Team Access

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes

1. **Reports:** Configure reports (e.g. overview, engagement, top posts) per profile or client. Align with your [Advanced Analytics Setup](advanced-analytics-setup.md) and [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) structure.
2. **Team members:** Invite team members or contractors. Assign roles (e.g. content creator, approver, viewer) and limit access to only the clients or profiles they need. Use [Team Management Templates](team-management-templates.zip) (ZIP) for role definitions.
3. **White-label (optional):** If your plan supports it, enable white-label reports so client-facing reports show your agency branding.

**What you'll have:** Reporting aligned with client deliverables and team access configured.

- Hootsuite account with a plan that fits your agency size
- Social profiles connected and organized by client
- Streams per client for monitoring and engagement
- Approval workflow and bulk scheduling in use
