# Agency Budget Planning — Content Specification

This file is the **content specification** for the PDF **Agency Budget Planning** (Level 3). Use it to regenerate or update the PDF so the wording and structure stay consistent with the package. Terminology follows [TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md](../docs/TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

**Level 3 context:** Full-service social media agency; time investment 8–12 weeks; expected revenue $3,000–$10,000+/month; platform costs $100–300/month.

---

## Section 1: Revenue Target

**Instructions:** State the revenue target band for Level 3.

- **Revenue target:** $3,000–$10,000+/month (or user’s specific number within this band).
- **Note:** This is agency revenue (retainers, add-ons, projects). Use terminology from `docs/TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md` (expected revenue, not "potential earnings").

---

## Section 2: Platform Costs

**Instructions:** Allocate platform and tool costs.

- **Platform costs (Level 3 range):** $100–300/month. List line items (e.g. Hootsuite, analytics tools, project management, other SaaS).
- **Total platform costs:** Sum. Update monthly as tools change.

---

## Section 3: P&L-Style Summary

**Instructions:** One-page profit-and-loss style summary.

- **Revenue:** Total revenue (by source if desired: retainer, add-ons, projects).
- **Costs:** Platform costs (Section 2); team/contractor costs; other direct costs (e.g. freelancers, ads spend on behalf of agency).
- **Gross margin or net (before owner pay):** Revenue minus costs. Optional: show as % of revenue.
- **Owner take-home or salary:** What you pay yourself. Document so the PDF supports [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md) (pricing and team cost).

---

## Section 4: Cash Flow

**Instructions:** Simple cash flow view.

- **Inflows:** When client payments hit (e.g. monthly on the 1st; net 15).
- **Outflows:** When platform, team, and other costs are due.
- **Buffer or reserve:** Recommended 1–2 months of fixed costs. Note in the PDF so users can track reserve over time.

---

## Section 5: Team and Contractors

**Instructions:** Track team and contractor cost.

- **Team/contractor cost per month:** List each role or contractor and monthly cost.
- **Total team cost:** Sum. Use with [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md) Part 3 (when to scale, pricing and team cost).
- **Notes:** When you added or changed team; when you plan to add next (e.g. at X clients or Y revenue).
