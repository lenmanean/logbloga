## Intended Contents of the ZIP

The Team Management Templates (ZIP) is a ready-to-use pack for running team operations in a social media agency. It aligns with the [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) so roles, kickoff, status, and handoff are consistent.

### File List and Purpose

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **README.md** | Short intro: what the pack is for (L3 social media agency team operations), how to use, links to Agency Operations Framework and Service Suite Development. |
| **team-roles-and-workflows.md** | Roles (strategy, content, scheduling, reporting, client comms) and who does what; align with Hootsuite Setup Guide and Agency Operations Framework Part 3. |
| **kickoff-agenda.md** | One-page kickoff agenda: intro, roles, scope, first deliverables, Q&A. |
| **status-report-template.md** | Biweekly or monthly status: deliverables, metrics, blockers, next 2 weeks. |
| **handoff-checklist.md** | Checklist for phase or project handoff: deliverables approved, sign-off, next phase, tasks closed. |

### Alignment with Package Content

- **Agency Operations Framework:** Part 3 (Team and Roles) and Part 2 (Client Lifecycle) define onboard, deliver, renew. These templates operationalize roles, kickoff, status, and handoff.
- **Service Suite Development:** Kickoff and status should reference service tiers and deliverables. Handoff supports phase or client transitions.
- **Hootsuite Setup Guide:** Team roles (content creator, approver, viewer) map to these templates for who does scheduling and approval.
