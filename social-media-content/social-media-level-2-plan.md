# Social Media Management Service — Implementation Plan

Step-by-step roadmap for offering social media management to clients so you can reach $1,000–$3,000/month.

## Overview

This implementation plan guides you through moving from personal brand or content creator to social media management service (SMM) over 4–6 weeks. You'll add Later, Metricool, Buffer paid; client onboarding and pricing frameworks; and first SMM clients so you can manage 3–5 clients and reach $1,000–$3,000/month.

**Who this is for:** Creators who have completed Level 1 (or equivalent) and want to offer SMM to others: scheduling, analytics, reporting, and client systems. AI leverage (ChatGPT, Canva AI, Buffer, Later) helps you scale content creation and manage multiple clients without burning out.

**Expected outcome:** Later, Metricool, and Buffer paid in use; Client Onboarding and Service Pricing frameworks completed; first SMM clients (1–3); Content Calendar, Client Reporting, and Client Onboarding Checklist in use; Service Pricing Strategy and SMM Budget Planner in use. Platform costs in the $30–100/month range for Level 2.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Later** (or equivalent scheduling/calendar tool for multi-client)
- **Metricool** (or equivalent analytics/reporting for clients)
- **Buffer** (paid tier or equivalent for multiple channels/clients)
- **Level 1 complete or equivalent** (niche, brand, content system, first monetization in place)

**Platform setup:** For step-by-step setup, use the Platform Setup Guides in this level: [Later Setup Guide](later-setup-guide.md), [Metricool Setup Guide](metricool-setup-guide.md), [Buffer Paid Setup Guide](buffer-paid-setup-guide.md).

## Working with AI Tools

AI can speed up batch captions, content ideas per client, and report summaries so you can manage 3–5 clients without sacrificing quality.

### For Non-Technical Users

**Effective communication with AI:**
- **Be specific:** Instead of "write captions," say "I manage social for [niche] clients. Write 5 Instagram captions for a post about [topic]. Tone: [friendly/professional]. Include a CTA. Keep under 150 words each."
- **Provide context:** Share client niche, brand voice, and platform so AI matches the client.
- **Give feedback:** "Make it more formal" or "Add a question." Always personalize before sending.

**What to use AI for:**
- **Batch captions:** Draft 5–10 captions per client per week; pick and personalize.
- **Content ideas:** "What content pillars work for [client niche] on [platform]?" Use for calendar planning.
- **Report summaries:** Paste metrics and ask AI for a 2–3 sentence summary for the client report.

**When to do it yourself:** Client relationships, strategy decisions, and final approval. AI drafts; you deliver and present.

### For All Users

**Use AI for:** Caption drafts, content ideas per client, report summary copy, and proposal drafts.

**Do yourself:** Choosing which clients to pursue, setting rates, onboarding, and client communication. Always review and personalize AI output before sending.

## Step-by-Step Roadmap

### Phase 1: Platforms and Positioning (Days 1–14)

#### Step 1.1: Set Up Later, Metricool, and Buffer Paid

**Time estimate:** 60–90 minutes total  
**Prerequisites:** Email; social accounts or client access  
**Expected outcome:** Later, Metricool, and Buffer paid in use so you can schedule, report, and manage multiple clients.

- **Later:** Follow the [Later Setup Guide](later-setup-guide.md). Create account, connect profiles (yours or client test), set up calendar view, and add first batch. Use for multi-client scheduling.
- **Metricool:** Follow the [Metricool Setup Guide](metricool-setup-guide.md). Create account, connect profiles, set up dashboards and reports. Use for client reporting.
- **Buffer paid:** Follow the [Buffer Paid Setup Guide](buffer-paid-setup-guide.md). Upgrade to paid tier, set up team/client structure, queue per client, and approval workflow if needed.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Later account and calendar in use; [ ] Metricool account and dashboards set; [ ] Buffer paid and multi-client structure in place

#### Step 1.2: Complete Client Onboarding and Service Pricing Frameworks

**Time estimate:** 90–120 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** None  
**Expected outcome:** Clear onboarding process and pricing so you can sign and deliver for clients.

- Complete the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md): kickoff (discovery, goals, access), brand and guidelines, content calendar setup, reporting cadence. Use with the [Client Onboarding Checklist](client-onboarding-checklist.pdf) (PDF) from the Templates section.
- Complete the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md): scope (channels, posts, ads), market and positioning, packages per client, retainers and add-ons. Use with the [Service Pricing Strategy](social-media-level-2-service-pricing-strategy.md) and [SMM Budget Planner](social-media-level-2-smm-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Client Onboarding Framework done; [ ] Service Pricing Framework done; [ ] Packages and pricing documented

### Phase 2: First SMM Clients (Days 15–28)

#### Step 2.1: Apply First SMM Clients Guide and Service Portfolio Checklist

**Time estimate:** 60–90 minutes to plan; ongoing to execute  
**Prerequisites:** Step 1.1 and 1.2 completed  
**Expected outcome:** Outreach in motion and portfolio or case studies ready so you can land 1–3 clients.

- Follow the [First SMM Clients Guide](social-media-level-2-first-smm-clients-guide.md): who to target, offer (packages), outreach (LinkedIn, referrals), proposal and close. **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft 2–3 proposal templates for SMM; personalize per client.
- Complete the [Service Portfolio Checklist](social-media-level-2-service-portfolio-checklist.md): what to show (case studies, results), where to host, how to use in proposals. Use your Level 1 content or personal brand results as first case studies if you don't have client work yet.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] First SMM Clients Guide applied; [ ] At least 5 outreach messages or proposals sent; [ ] Service portfolio or case studies ready

#### Step 2.2: Deploy Content Calendar, Client Reporting, and Client Onboarding Checklist

**Time estimate:** 45–60 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** At least one client in pipeline or signed  
**Expected outcome:** Content Calendar Template (XLSX), Client Reporting Template (DOCX), and Client Onboarding Checklist (PDF) in use so delivery is consistent.

- Use the [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template.xlsx) (XLSX) from the Templates section: plan by client, date, platform, content type, copy, status. Or use a simple spreadsheet with the same columns.
- Customize the [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) (DOCX): summary, metrics, top posts, recommendations. Use with Metricool data.
- Use the [Client Onboarding Checklist](client-onboarding-checklist.pdf) (PDF) for every new client: access, brand, calendar, first report date.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Content Calendar in use for at least one client; [ ] Client Reporting Template customized; [ ] Client Onboarding Checklist used for first client

### Phase 3: Operations (Days 29–42)

#### Step 3.1: Use Client & Service Issues Guide for Any Issues

Use the [Client & Service Issues](social-media-level-2-client-service-issues.md) guide for scope and deliverables, client communication, multi-client capacity, and billing and contracts. For each issue: causes, step-by-step resolution, prevention, when to escalate.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Troubleshooting guide read; [ ] Used when any client or service issue arises

#### Step 3.2: Service Pricing Strategy and SMM Budget Planner

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes monthly  
**Prerequisites:** At least one client and some revenue  
**Expected outcome:** Pricing and budget under control so you can scale to $1,000–$3,000/month.

- Use the [Service Pricing Strategy](social-media-level-2-service-pricing-strategy.md): when to raise, how to communicate, package evolution. Use with the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md).
- Use the [SMM Budget Planner](social-media-level-2-smm-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section: revenue goal ($1k–$3k), platform costs ($30–100), income and expense tracking, net. Update monthly.
