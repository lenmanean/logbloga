# Creator Income Planning (Level 1)

How to plan your income goals, revenue streams, and action steps so you can reach $300–$1,000/month as a personal brand or content creator.

## Purpose

This guide helps you set income goals ($300–$1,000 band for Level 1), choose and prioritize revenue streams (affiliate, sponsored, product), set a timeline, and list concrete action steps. Use it with the [First Monetization Guide](social-media-level-1-first-monetization-guide.md) and the **Monetization Budget Worksheet** (PDF) from the Planning section so your revenue plan is clear and trackable.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 30–45 minutes to plan; then review monthly or when you add a new stream.  
- **When:** Use after you've defined your niche ( [Niche Selection Worksheet](niche-selection-worksheet.md) ) and taken at least one monetization action ( [First Monetization Guide](social-media-level-1-first-monetization-guide.md) ).  
- **Cross-ref:** Use the [Monetization Budget Worksheet](social-media-level-1-monetization-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) to track revenue, platform costs ($0–30), and net.

Complete each part below. Use the results to guide what you do next (e.g. apply to one more affiliate program, outreach to 2 more brands, or launch one product).
