# Niche Selection Worksheet

Guided exercises to choose a niche that supports monetization so you can build a personal brand or content creator presence in the $300–$1,000/month range.

## Purpose

A clear niche helps you create consistent content, attract a defined audience, and choose monetization that fits (affiliate, sponsored, or product). One focused niche makes it easier to plan content pillars, write captions, and reach your first revenue. Without it, your content and audience stay scattered and monetization is harder.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 30–45 minutes  
- **When:** Complete early in Level 1 (Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](social-media-level-1-plan.md)); before Brand Identity and Content Direction.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to brainstorm niches from your interests ("What niches could I focus on as a content creator given [my interests]?"), then choose and personalize.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in the [Brand Identity Framework](brand-identity-framework.md) and [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md).

**Why this fits my niche and audience:**
