# Brand Identity Framework

Guided exercises to define your brand voice, visual style, bio, and one-liner so your content is consistent and recognizable—supporting $300–$1,000/month as a personal brand or content creator.

## Purpose

A clear brand identity (voice, visual, bio) makes your content recognizable and builds trust with your audience. Consistency in look and tone helps you stand out and supports monetization (affiliate, sponsored, product). Without it, your feed feels random and brands and followers don't know what you stand for.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes  
- **When:** Complete after the [Niche Selection Worksheet](niche-selection-worksheet.md) (Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](social-media-level-1-plan.md)); before Content Direction and first posts.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft 3 bio options from your niche statement; pick one and tweak for your voice.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in the [Canva Setup Guide](canva-setup-guide.md) (brand kit) and in your profile bios and content.

## Part 1: Voice and Tone

### How you sound in captions and content

**My voice is (e.g. friendly, professional, casual, expert):**
_________________________________________________

**I avoid (e.g. jargon, slang, overly salesy):**
_________________________________________________

**In captions I (e.g. ask questions, tell stories, share tips):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "My voice is friendly and practical. I avoid jargon and hype. In captions I share one tip, ask a question, and add a CTA (save, follow, link in bio)."

## Part 2: Visual (Colors, Fonts, Style)

### How your content looks

**Primary color (hex or name):**
_________________________________________________

**Secondary color(s):**
_________________________________________________

**Font style (e.g. clean, bold, playful):**
_________________________________________________

**Visual style (e.g. minimal, bright, dark, illustrated):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Primary: #2563EB (blue). Secondary: #F59E0B (amber), #1F2937 (dark gray). Fonts: clean sans-serif for headings, readable for body. Style: minimal, lots of white space, simple icons."

**Use these in:** [Canva Setup Guide](canva-setup-guide.md) Brand Kit (colors, fonts) and templates.

## Part 3: Bio and One-Liner

### What appears on your profile

**One-liner (from [Niche Selection Worksheet](niche-selection-worksheet.md) or refine here):**
_________________________________________________

**Bio (2–3 lines: who you help, what you offer, CTA):**
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

**CTA for bio (e.g. "Link in bio," "DM for templates," "Subscribe"):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "One-liner: I create productivity tips for remote workers. Bio: Helping remote workers get more done without burnout. Tips, templates, and systems. Link below for free Notion template. CTA: Link in bio."

## Part 4: Canva Brand Kit Alignment

### Make sure Canva matches your brand

- [ ] **Colors:** Add your primary and secondary colors to Canva Brand Kit (or save in a doc and use in each design).  
- [ ] **Fonts:** Set 1–2 brand fonts in Canva (Free has limited fonts; Pro unlocks more).  
- [ ] **Templates:** When you pick templates in the [Canva Setup Guide](canva-setup-guide.md), choose ones that fit your visual style (minimal, bold, etc.).  
- [ ] **Consistency:** Every post should use your colors and fonts so your feed looks cohesive.

**What you'll have when done:** A defined voice, visual (colors, fonts, style), bio, and one-liner—and Canva set up to match. Use this in the [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) and in every caption and design.
