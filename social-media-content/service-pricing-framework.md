# Service Pricing Framework

Guided exercises to price SMM services without undercharging so you can reach $1,000–$3,000/month.

## Purpose

A clear pricing framework (scope, market, packages, retainers and add-ons) helps you set rates that cover your time and platform costs and position you above commodity SMM. For Level 2, pricing per client with clear scope (channels, posts, ads) and packages (Basic/Standard/Premium or custom) supports $1,000–$3,000/month when you have 3–5 clients. Without it, you'll underprice or overpromise and burn out.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 30–45 minutes  
- **When:** Use before landing clients (Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](social-media-level-2-plan.md)); align with [Service Pricing Strategy](social-media-level-2-service-pricing-strategy.md) and [SMM Budget Planner](social-media-level-2-smm-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to research "SMM pricing per client [niche]" or "social media management monthly retainer"; then set your own based on scope and market.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in proposals and in the [Service Pricing Strategy](social-media-level-2-service-pricing-strategy.md) when you raise rates.

## Part 1: Scope (Channels, Posts, Ads)

### What you'll deliver per client

**Channels you'll manage (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, TikTok):**
_________________________________________________

**Posts per week per channel (e.g. 5 Instagram, 3 Facebook):**
_________________________________________________

**Ads (yes/no; if yes, budget and management fee):**
_________________________________________________

**Reporting (e.g. monthly PDF + 1-page summary):**
_________________________________________________

**Other (e.g. community management, DMs):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Channels: Instagram + Facebook. Posts: 5 Instagram, 3 Facebook per week. No ads for Level 2 start. Reporting: monthly PDF + 1-page summary. No community management (out of scope)."

## Part 2: Market and Positioning

### What others charge and where you sit

**Competitors or similar SMM (what they charge):**
_________________________________________________

**Your positioning (e.g. premium, mid-market, volume):**
_________________________________________________

**Your minimum monthly retainer (below this you won't take a client):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Competitors: $500–$1,200/month for similar scope. I'll position at $700–$900/month (mid-market, quality content + reporting). Minimum: $600/month."

---

## Part 3: Packages (Per Client)

### Define 1–3 packages or custom scope

**Package 1 (e.g. Basic):** Scope: _________________________________________________ | Price: $_________/month  

**Package 2 (e.g. Standard):** Scope: _________________________________________________ | Price: $_________/month  

**Package 3 (e.g. Premium or custom):** Scope: _________________________________________________ | Price: $_________/month  

**Example:** "Basic: 1 channel, 3 posts/week, monthly report — $600/month. Standard: 2 channels, 5+3 posts/week, monthly report — $850/month. Premium: 3 channels, 5+5+3 posts/week, monthly report + strategy call — $1,200/month."

---

## Part 4: Retainers and Add-Ons

### Recurring vs one-off and what's extra

**Retainer (monthly):** What's included (e.g. X posts, 1 report, 1 revision round):  
_________________________________________________

**Add-ons (extra cost):** E.g. extra posts $X each, ads management $Y/month, extra report $Z:  
_________________________________________________

**Contract length (e.g. month-to-month, 3-month min):**  
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Retainer includes 20 posts/month, 1 monthly report, 1 round of revisions. Add-ons: extra post $25, ads setup $150 one-time. Month-to-month with 30-day notice."
