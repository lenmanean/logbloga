# Advanced Analytics Setup

Step-by-step setup for an advanced analytics stack so you can deliver agency-level reporting and client KPIs.

## Overview

This guide helps agency leads (Level 3, $3,000–$10,000+/month) set up an analytics stack for multi-client reporting: tool choice (e.g. GA4, native platforms, dashboards), client views, KPIs, and report templates. Platform costs for Level 3 are in the $100–300/month range; analytics tools are typically part of that stack.

**Why for agency:** One place to see performance across clients, consistent KPIs, and report templates that scale so you can deliver value without manual wrangling.

## Prerequisites

- **Level 2 complete or equivalent** (SMM clients, Metricool or similar in use)
- **Access** to client websites or social accounts for tracking
- **Reporting cadence** agreed with clients (from [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) or agency onboarding)

## Step 1: Choose Your Analytics Stack

**Time estimate:** 20–30 minutes

1. **Define needs:** List what you must report: website traffic, social engagement, conversions, ROI. Decide if you need one tool or a combo (e.g. GA4 + native + Hootsuite/Metricool).
2. **Options (examples):**
   - **GA4:** Free; site traffic, events, goals. Use for clients with websites or landing pages.
   - **Native platforms:** Instagram Insights, Facebook Meta Business Suite, LinkedIn Analytics. Free; use for platform-specific metrics.
   - **Aggregators:** Metricool, Hootsuite Analytics, or similar. Paid; multi-profile dashboards and exports.
   - **Dashboards:** Google Data Studio (Looker Studio), Supermetrics, or similar. Paid/freemium; build client-specific dashboards.
3. **Choose:** Pick the smallest set that covers your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and client expectations. Document in your [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) Part 4 (Systems).

**What you'll have:** A clear analytics stack (e.g. GA4 + native + one aggregator or dashboard tool).

## Step 2: Set Up Client Views and Properties

**Time estimate:** 25–40 minutes (per client, first time; faster once templated)

1. **GA4 (if used):** For each client with a website, create a GA4 property (or use their existing one with appropriate access). Set up data streams (web/app), link to ads if relevant. Use a consistent naming convention (e.g. "Client Name – Web").
2. **Native:** Ensure you have Insights/Analytics access for each client’s profiles. No extra "setup" beyond access; note where you’ll pull numbers for reports.
3. **Aggregator/dashboard:** If using Metricool, Hootsuite, or a dashboard tool, connect each client’s profiles and (if applicable) GA4. Create one view or dashboard per client so you don’t mix data.

**What you'll have:** Each client has a dedicated view or property in your stack so reporting stays clean and client-specific.

## Step 3: Define KPIs and Report Templates

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes

1. **KPIs:** Define 5–8 KPIs you’ll report for most clients (e.g. reach, engagement rate, clicks, conversions, follower growth). Align with your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) and [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template-spec.md): summary, metrics, top posts, recommendations.
2. **Templates:** Create a report template (in DOCX, dashboard, or export) that matches your deliverable. Sections: summary, metrics table, top posts, recommendations. Use the same structure for every client; only the numbers and copy change. See [Client Reporting Template spec](client-reporting-template-spec.md).
3. **Cadence:** Set a reminder or calendar event for each client’s report (e.g. first Monday of month). Use your [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) and onboarding notes.

**What you'll have:** Standard KPIs and a repeatable report template so you can produce client reports quickly and consistently.

## Step 4: Automate Where Possible

**Time estimate:** 20–40 minutes (depends on tools)

1. **Exports:** If your aggregator or GA4 supports scheduled exports (e.g. CSV or PDF), set them up per client so data lands in a folder or email on report day.
2. **Dashboards:** If using Looker Studio or similar, build one dashboard per client (or one template duplicated per client). Share view-only links with clients if that’s your model.
3. **AI (optional):** Use AI to turn raw numbers into 2–3 sentence summaries for the "Summary" section of the report. Always review before sending. See [Level 3 Plan – Working with AI](social-media-level-3-plan.md#working-with-ai-tools).

**What you'll have:** Less manual copy-paste and faster report creation, with summaries that stay on-brand.

## What You'll Have When Done

- A chosen analytics stack (GA4, native, aggregator/dashboard)
- Client-specific views or properties for each client
- Defined KPIs and a report template aligned with deliverables
- Automation (exports, dashboards, optional AI summaries) to speed up reporting

## Time Estimate Summary

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| 1. Choose stack | 20–30 min |
| 2. Client views | 25–40 min (first client); repeat per client |
| 3. KPIs and templates | 30–45 min |
| 4. Automate | 20–40 min |
| **Total (first time)** | **~95–155 min** |
