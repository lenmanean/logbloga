# First Monetization Guide (Level 1)

How to start monetizing your personal brand or content creator presence so you can reach $300–$1,000/month.

## Overview

First monetization means turning your audience and content into at least one revenue stream: **affiliate** (earn from links), **sponsored** (brands pay you to promote), or **product** (you sell digital or physical). For Level 1, pick one path to start so you don't spread yourself thin. This guide covers how to choose programs, disclose, track (affiliate); how to set rates, outreach, and contracts (sponsored); and how to list and sell (product)—within Level 1 time investment (2–3 weeks) and platform costs ($0–30/month).

## Prerequisites

- Niche and audience defined (use the [Niche Selection Worksheet](niche-selection-worksheet.md))
- Some content live and consistent (use the [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md))
- Optional: [Creator Income Planning](social-media-level-1-creator-income-planning.md) and [Monetization Budget Worksheet](social-media-level-1-monetization-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section

## Step 1: Affiliate (Choose Programs, Disclose, Track)

**Time:** ~30–45 minutes to start  
**Purpose:** Earn from links when your audience buys or signs up—so you get revenue without creating a product.

### Sub-step 1.1: Choose programs that fit your niche

1. **Research:** Find affiliate programs that match your niche and audience (e.g. productivity apps, courses, tools). Use program directories (e.g. ShareASale, Amazon Associates, partner pages of brands you already recommend).
2. **Apply:** Sign up for 1–2 programs to start. Many approve quickly; some require a minimum audience or content sample. Use your niche and content to explain why you're a fit.
3. **Get links:** Once approved, get your unique affiliate links (or use a link-in-bio tool that supports UTM and affiliate URLs). **AI tip:** "What affiliate programs fit [niche] content creators?" to get ideas.

### Sub-step 1.2: Disclose and stay compliant

1. **Disclose:** In every post or caption where you use an affiliate link, disclose that you may earn a commission (e.g. "Link in bio (affiliate)" or "I may earn a small commission if you buy"). Platform and FTC rules require clear disclosure.
2. **Placement:** Put the disclosure where viewers see it before they click (in caption, on image, or in first line of bio). Don't hide it.
3. **Stay compliant:** Follow each program's terms (e.g. no misleading claims, no incentivized reviews without disclosure). See [Common Creator Issues](social-media-level-1-common-creator-issues.md) if you're unsure.

### Sub-step 1.3: Track and optimize

1. **Track:** Use UTM parameters or the program's dashboard to see clicks and conversions. Use [Google Analytics Setup Guide](google-analytics-setup-guide.md) if your link-in-bio or site supports it.
2. **Optimize:** Double down on content that drives clicks and sales (e.g. tool reviews, "how I use X"). Use the [Content Growth Checklist](social-media-level-1-content-growth-checklist.md) and weekly analytics review.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one affiliate program applied and approved; [ ] Affiliate link live (e.g. in bio or post); [ ] Disclosure in place; [ ] Tracking set up

## Step 2: Sponsored (Rates, Outreach, Contracts)

**Time:** ~45–60 minutes to start  
**Purpose:** Get brands to pay you to promote their product or service—so you earn from sponsored posts or stories.

### Sub-step 2.1: Set your rates

1. **Research:** Look at what similar creators in your niche charge (e.g. $X per 10k followers per post, or flat fee per post/story). Use "creator rate card" or "influencer pricing" searches; adjust for your audience size and engagement.
2. **Rate card:** Draft a simple rate card (e.g. 1 feed post $X, 1 story $Y, package of 3 posts $Z). Use the [Creator Income Planning](social-media-level-1-creator-income-planning.md) to align with your income goal ($300–$1,000/month for Level 1).
3. **Deliverables:** Define what's included (e.g. 1 post, 1 revision, usage for 30 days). Don't underprice—include your time and audience value.

### Sub-step 2.2: Identify brands and outreach

1. **Brands:** List 5–10 brands that fit your niche and audience (products or services your audience already uses or would trust). Check if they have a "creator" or "influencer" or "partnerships" page.
2. **Outreach:** Send a short email or DM: who you are, your niche, audience size and engagement, and what you offer (e.g. 1 post, 1 story). Include a link to your profile or media kit. **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft 2–3 outreach emails; personalize for each brand.
3. **Follow up:** If no reply in 5–7 days, one brief follow-up. Then move on; don't spam.

### Sub-step 2.3: Contracts and disclosure

1. **Contract:** When a brand says yes, get scope and payment in writing (email is fine for Level 1: deliverables, fee, payment date, usage rights). Use a simple agreement template if they don't send one.
2. **Disclosure:** Mark sponsored content per platform rules (e.g. #ad, "Paid partnership," "Sponsored"). Always disclose before the fold or in the first line.
3. **Deliver:** Post on time, tag the brand, and send proof (screenshot or link). Invoice if needed; use the [Monetization Budget Worksheet](social-media-level-1-monetization-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) to track income.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Rate card drafted; [ ] At least 2–3 brands identified and contacted; [ ] Contract and disclosure process clear; [ ] First sponsored post (when you get one) delivered and disclosed

## Step 3: Product (Digital or Physical, Link in Bio)

**Time:** ~45–60 minutes to start  
**Purpose:** Sell something you create (digital or physical) so you earn directly from your audience.

### Sub-step 3.1: Decide what to sell

1. **Digital:** Templates, ebooks, guides, courses, or presets. Low overhead; you create once and sell many times. Fit: niche expertise (e.g. Notion templates for productivity).
2. **Physical:** Merch, prints, or products. Higher effort and cost; only if you have demand and capacity. Fit: audience that already asks for merch or tangible items.
3. **Start small:** One digital product (e.g. one template, one short guide) or one physical product (e.g. one design on a print-on-demand site). Use the [Niche Selection Worksheet](niche-selection-worksheet.md) Part 3 to confirm demand.

### Sub-step 3.2: Set up and list

1. **Platform:** Use a simple store (e.g. Gumroad, Stan Store, Etsy for digital; Printful/Printify for merch) or link to a landing page. For Level 1, one link in bio is enough.
2. **Listing:** Clear title, short description, price, and one image or preview. **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft product description and benefits; then personalize.
3. **Link in bio:** Add your product link to your link-in-bio (Instagram, TikTok, etc.). Use UTM parameters so you can track traffic from each platform (see [Google Analytics Setup Guide](google-analytics-setup-guide.md)).

### Sub-step 3.3: Promote and track

1. **Promote:** Mention your product in content (e.g. "I use this template daily—link in bio") without being spammy. One post or story per week is a good start.
2. **Track:** Use your store's dashboard or GA4 to see visits and sales. Use the [Monetization Budget Worksheet](social-media-level-1-monetization-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) to record income.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] One product decided and created (or listed); [ ] Link in bio set; [ ] At least one post or story promoting the product; [ ] Income tracked in budget worksheet

## What You'll Have When Done
