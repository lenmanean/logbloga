# Partnership & Outreach Strategies

How to build partnerships and referral pipelines so you can reach $3,000–$10,000+/month.

## Overview

Partnerships (other agencies, brands, complementary services) and referral agreements can fill your pipeline without cold outreach alone. For Level 3, a clear partnership strategy supports consistent leads and higher-ticket clients. This guide covers types of partners, how to approach them, referral agreements, and tracking. Expected revenue for Level 3: $3,000–$10,000+/month; platform costs $100–300/month.

## Why Partnerships Matter

Referrals from trusted partners often close faster and at better rates. By defining who makes a good partner and how you'll work together, you create a repeatable pipeline. Use your [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md) so partners know exactly what you do and who you serve.

## Step 1: Types of Partners

**Time estimate:** 15–20 minutes

#### 1.1 Who to target

**Agencies (marketing, PR, web, branding):** They have clients who need social but don't do it in-house. You become their social arm.  
**Brands (non-competing):** Co-marketing or cross-promotion; sometimes they refer B2B contacts.  
**Complementary services (copywriters, designers, coaches, consultants):** They serve the same audience; you refer to each other or bundle.

**Your list (names or types):**
- Agencies: _________________________________________________
- Brands: _________________________________________________
- Complementary: _________________________________________________

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least 5–10 potential partners identified (names or types)

## Step 2: How to Approach

**Time estimate:** 30–45 minutes to draft; ongoing to execute

#### 2.1 Outreach message (short)

- **Intro:** Who you are and what you do (one line from your [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md)).
- **Why them:** "We work with [ideal client]; you serve [their clients]. We're looking for 2–3 referral partners."
- **Ask:** "Would you be open to a 15-min call to see if we're a fit for referrals?"
- **No pitch:** First contact is about fit, not selling them a service.

**Example:** "Hi [Name], I run [Agency]. We do full-service social for B2B and professional services. I see you work with [their clients]. We're building a small referral network and wondered if you'd be open to a short call to see if we could refer fits to each other. No pitch—just see if it makes sense. [Your name]"

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Outreach template drafted; [ ] 5–10 messages sent (LinkedIn, email, or both)

#### 2.2 Follow-up

- If no reply: one polite follow-up after 5–7 days.
- If yes: book a 15–20 min call. Share positioning and ideal client; ask about theirs. Propose a simple referral agreement (next step).

## Step 3: Referral Agreements

**Time estimate:** 20–30 minutes per partner (once you've agreed in principle)

#### 3.1 What to agree on

- **Who refers whom:** E.g. they refer clients who need social; you refer clients who need web or PR.
- **Referral fee or reciprocal:** E.g. 10% of first 3 months, or no fee but reciprocal referrals. Keep it simple.
- **How to refer:** E.g. intro email, or "send them our calendar link." Define one clear handoff.
- **No exclusivity (usually):** You can have multiple partners; they can have multiple social partners unless you agree otherwise.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one referral agreement in place (even informal); [ ] Handoff process clear

#### 3.2 When to escalate

- If a partner sends bad-fit leads repeatedly, clarify ideal client and referral criteria. See [Agency Operations Issues](social-media-level-3-agency-operations-issues.md) (Partnerships and referrals section).
- If you disagree on fee or terms, put it in a short written agreement (email or 1-pager) so expectations are clear.

## Step 4: Tracking

**Time estimate:** 10–15 minutes to set up; 5–10 minutes weekly

#### 4.1 What to track

- **Partners:** Name, type (agency/brand/complementary), status (contacted / call done / agreement yes/no).
- **Referrals:** Source (which partner), date, outcome (won / lost / pending).
- **Pipeline:** How many leads from partnerships vs other sources (e.g. inbound, cold). Use this to double down on what works.

**Simple options:** Spreadsheet (partner name, referral date, outcome) or a column in your CRM. No need for fancy tools at Level 3.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Tracking in place; [ ] Reviewed weekly or monthly with [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md)
