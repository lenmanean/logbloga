# Full-Service Social Media Agency — Implementation Plan

Step-by-step roadmap for running a full-service social media agency so you can reach $3,000–$10,000+/month.

## Overview

This implementation plan guides you through scaling from SMM service to full-service social media agency over 8–12 weeks. You'll add Hootsuite, advanced analytics, agency operations and service suite, team management, partnership outreach, and revenue strategy so you can run a lean team and reach $3,000–$10,000+/month.

**Who this is for:** Agency leads who have completed Level 2 (or equivalent) and want to position as an agency: Hootsuite, advanced analytics, agency operations, service suite, positioning, and partnerships. AI leverage (workflow tools, analytics AI) supports thought leadership, proposal and positioning copy, and reporting automation while you keep relationships and strategy human.

**Expected outcome:** Agency positioning and service suite defined; Hootsuite and advanced analytics in use; Team Management Templates (ZIP) in use; Agency Positioning Guide and Partnership & Outreach Strategies applied; Agency Operations Issues guide bookmarked; Agency Revenue Strategy and Agency Budget Planning (PDF) in use. Platform costs in the $100–300/month range for Level 3.

## Working with AI Tools

AI can support thought leadership, proposal and positioning copy, and reporting automation so you can scale with a lean team.

### For Non-Technical Users

**Effective use of AI:**
- **Positioning copy:** "I run a social media agency serving [niche]. Write a positioning statement and 3 proof points for our website." Edit for your voice.
- **Proposal drafts:** "We offer [services]. Write a 1-page proposal structure with summary, scope, deliverables, and investment." Fill in numbers and specifics.
- **Report automation:** Use AI to summarize metrics into client-friendly language; you approve and send.

**When to do it yourself:** Client relationships, strategy, and final approval. AI drafts; you own the relationship and the decision.

### For All Users

**Use AI for:** Thought leadership posts, positioning and proposal copy, report summaries and automation.

**Do yourself:** Strategy, pricing, partnerships, and client relationships. Always review and personalize AI output.
