# Content Growth Checklist (Level 1)

A checklist for posting consistency, engagement habits, and analytics review so you grow your personal brand or content creator presence toward $300–$1,000/month.

## Purpose

Consistent posting and engagement build reach and trust; regular analytics review tells you what to do more of. This checklist helps you stay on track with posting, hashtags, collaborations, and weekly review—without burning out. Use it with the [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) and [Buffer](buffer-setup-guide.md) so your content system is sustainable.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 15–20 minutes per day (posting + engagement); 30–45 minutes per week (analytics review).  
- **When:** Use daily for posting and engagement; use weekly (e.g. Sunday or Monday) for analytics review.  
- **Cross-ref:** Use with the [Daily Posting Checklist](daily-posting-checklist.pdf) (PDF) from the Templates section for morning check, content batch, scheduling, and end-of-day.

## Step 1: Posting Consistency

**Time:** Ongoing (batch 1–2× per week; queue daily or weekly)  
**Purpose:** Post on a schedule so your audience and algorithms see you regularly.

### Sub-steps

1. **Stick to your cadence:** Use the cadence from your [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) Part 3 (e.g. 5 posts per week). Don't skip weeks—consistency matters more than volume at first.
2. **Use Buffer (or your scheduler):** Fill your [Buffer](buffer-setup-guide.md) queue 1–2 times per week so you're never scrambling. Use the Content Strategy Template (XLSX) or a simple spreadsheet to plan by date and pillar.
3. **Mix pillars and formats:** Rotate your 3–5 pillars and formats (reels, carousels, etc.) so your feed stays varied and you test what works.
4. **Check before posting:** Use the [Daily Posting Checklist](daily-posting-checklist.pdf) (PDF) morning check: confirm today's posts are queued and correct (caption, image, link).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Cadence set and stuck to for 2+ weeks; [ ] Buffer queue filled at least 1× per week; [ ] Pillars and formats mixed

## Step 2: Engagement Habits

**Time:** 10–15 minutes per day  
**Purpose:** Reply and engage so your audience and algorithms reward you.

### Sub-steps

1. **Reply to everyone:** Reply to every comment and DM (or set a daily goal, e.g. 10 replies). Do it within 24 hours when possible. Authentic replies build community and signal engagement to the platform.
2. **Comment on others' posts:** Comment on 3–5 posts in your niche per day (add value—ask a question, share a tip). Don't copy-paste; be genuine. This can bring new followers and relationships.
3. **Save and share:** Save or share 1–2 posts that inspire you (stories or feed). Tag the creator when you share. This builds goodwill and can lead to collaborations.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Replies and comments part of daily routine; [ ] At least 3–5 comments per day in your niche; [ ] Saves/shares when you find something useful

## Step 3: Hashtags and Discoverability

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes once; then reuse and tweak  
**Purpose:** Use hashtags (where the platform supports them) so new people can find you.

### Sub-steps

1. **Research hashtags:** Find 10–20 hashtags that fit your niche and size (mix of broad and niche). Use platform search or tools (e.g. Instagram hashtag suggestions). Avoid only huge hashtags (you'll get buried) or only tiny ones (no discovery).
2. **Save a set:** Save 2–3 sets of hashtags (e.g. one set for tips, one for tools, one for behind-the-scenes) in a note or doc. Rotate so you're not always using the same set.
3. **Placement:** Use hashtags in caption or first comment per platform norms. Don't stuff; keep it relevant. **AI tip:** "What hashtags do [niche] creators use on [platform]?" to get ideas.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one set of 10–15 hashtags saved; [ ] Hashtags used consistently on posts; [ ] Refreshed every few weeks based on performance

## Step 4: Collaborations (Optional)

**Time:** As opportunities arise  
**Purpose:** Collaborate with other creators to cross-promote and grow.

### Sub-steps

1. **Identify collaborators:** Find 2–3 creators in your niche (similar or slightly larger audience). Engage with their content first; don't cold-DM "collab?"
2. **Propose a simple collab:** E.g. "I'll share your post in my story if you share mine," or "Let's do a joint carousel or live." Keep it low-lift at first.
3. **Deliver and tag:** When you collab, deliver on time and tag them. Thank them in caption or story. This builds relationships and can lead to more collabs or referrals.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] At least one collaboration (story share, joint post, or shoutout) completed or planned; [ ] Collaborator tagged and thanked

## Step 5: Analytics Review (Weekly)

**Time:** 30–45 minutes per week  
**Purpose:** See what's working so you can do more of it.

### Sub-steps

1. **Platform insights:** Open your platform's native analytics (Instagram Insights, TikTok Analytics, etc.). Note: top posts by reach, engagement, and saves/shares. Note: best posting times and audience demographics.
2. **Google Analytics (if you have a site or link-in-bio):** Use the [Google Analytics Setup Guide](google-analytics-setup-guide.md). Check: traffic sources (which platform sends clicks), top pages, and conversions (link clicks, sign-ups). Use UTM parameters so you know which content drives clicks.
3. **Adjust:** Double down on content that gets reach, engagement, or conversions. Reduce or stop what doesn't. Update your [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) or Content Strategy Template if you discover a new pillar or format that works.
4. **Track in budget worksheet:** Use the [Monetization Budget Worksheet](social-media-level-1-monetization-budget-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) to record any income (affiliate, sponsored, product) so you know your progress toward $300–$1,000/month.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Weekly analytics review on calendar; [ ] Top posts and sources noted; [ ] At least one change made (e.g. more of X, less of Y); [ ] Income tracked in budget worksheet
