# Agency Operations Issues

Common issues when running a social media agency and how to resolve them. For Level 3 ($3,000–$10,000+/month).

## How to Use This Guide

For each issue we give **Causes**, **Step-by-step resolution**, **Prevention**, and **When to escalate**. Use the [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md), [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md), [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md), and [Partnership & Outreach Strategies](social-media-level-3-partnership-outreach-strategies.md) to avoid or fix issues. If something is outside your control or legal/financial, escalate to a lawyer, accountant, or senior advisor.

## Positioning and Pricing

### Issue: We sound like every other agency and can't command premium rates

**Causes:** Generic messaging; no clear niche or differentiator; pricing based on guesswork instead of scope and market.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Complete or revisit the [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) Part 1 (Positioning and offer) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) Part 3 (Positioning vs competitors).
2. Write one positioning statement: who you serve, what you do, why you're different. Use it on the website, in proposals, and on LinkedIn. See [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md).
3. Benchmark: research what similar agencies charge for your scope. Set a minimum retainer and tier prices using the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) logic (even if you're L3) and [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md).
4. Update all client-facing materials (website, proposal template) with the new positioning and pricing. Stop discounting without a clear reason (e.g. case study, long-term commitment).

**Prevention:** Review positioning and pricing quarterly. Add proof points (case studies, testimonials) so you can justify premium rates.

**When to escalate:** If you've done the above and still can't close at your target price, consider a niche pivot or a mentor/coach who has scaled an agency.

### Issue: Scope creep—clients expect more than we sold

**Causes:** Vague contract or proposal; no clear "out of scope" list; saying yes to one-off requests without updating scope or price.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Document what's in scope and what's not (channels, post count, reporting, ads, community management, etc.). Use your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) tiers.
2. Add a "scope" or "deliverables" section to your contract and proposal. List exclusions (e.g. "Community management and DM replies are out of scope unless added as an add-on").
3. When a client asks for something new: "That's outside our current scope. We can add it as an add-on for $X/month or as a one-off project for $Y." Get agreement in writing before doing the work.
4. If you've already been doing extra work for free, schedule a short call: "We've been doing [X] which wasn't in the original scope. Going forward we'd like to add it formally for $Z/month so we can keep delivering at this level." Be polite and firm.

**Prevention:** Every new client: clear scope in proposal and contract. At renewal, revisit scope and adjust price if deliverables have grown.

**When to escalate:** If the client refuses to pay for added scope or threatens to leave, decide whether to hold the line or make a one-time exception. If it becomes a pattern, consider ending the contract at renewal.

## Client and Delivery

### Issue: Client is unhappy with results or reporting

**Causes:** Mismatched expectations; KPIs not agreed at onboarding; report format or cadence not what they wanted; results below their hopes.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Schedule a call. Ask: "What would make our reporting (or results) more useful for you?" Listen first; don't defend.
2. Revisit goals and KPIs from onboarding. Align reports with those KPIs. Use the [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) structure (summary, metrics, top posts, recommendations).
3. If results are low: share what you've tried, what's working, and a clear plan for the next 30–60 days (e.g. new content format, different posting times). Set one or two measurable goals and a review date.
4. Document the conversation and any new agreements (email or short summary). Follow up on the next report with the agreed format and goals.

**Prevention:** Set expectations at onboarding: what you'll report, how often, and what "success" looks like in 90 days. Use the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) and [Client Onboarding Checklist](client-onboarding-checklist.pdf).

**When to escalate:** If the client is abusive or refuses to pay despite delivered work, consider pausing delivery and seeking legal advice. If they're simply not a fit, plan an offboarding and end the contract at renewal.

### Issue: Delivering late or missing deadlines

**Causes:** Too many clients for current capacity; no buffer in the calendar; approval bottlenecks; unclear ownership (who drafts, who approves).

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Map current capacity: hours per week for content, scheduling, reporting, and client communication. Compare to what each client contract requires. If you're over capacity, either reduce scope per client, raise prices, or add help (contractor or hire). See [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md) (team cost).
2. Build buffer: set internal deadlines 2–3 days before client-facing deadlines so you have time for revisions.
3. Clarify approval: who approves posts and reports, and how long they have. Document in [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) and in client onboarding. If the client is slow to approve, remind them of the agreed turnaround and its impact on publish dates.
4. Use [Hootsuite](hootsuite-setup-guide.md) and [Advanced Analytics](advanced-analytics-setup.md) to batch work and automate reporting where possible.

**Prevention:** Cap client count or total scope until you have a repeatable system. Use [Team Management Templates](team-management-templates.zip) (ZIP) if you have a team. Review capacity monthly.

**When to escalate:** If you're chronically over capacity and revenue doesn't support hiring, consider raising prices or pausing new client acquisition until delivery is stable.

## Team and Capacity

### Issue: Team or contractors are unclear on roles or deadlines

**Causes:** Roles not documented; handoffs unclear; no single place for deadlines and tasks.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Document roles: who does strategy, content, scheduling, reporting, client communication. Use [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) Part 3 and [Team Management Templates](team-management-templates.zip) (ZIP).
2. Define handoffs: e.g. "Content creator delivers assets by Tuesday; scheduler publishes by Thursday; report goes out first Monday of month." Put this in a one-pager or project tool.
3. Use a shared calendar or task list (even a simple spreadsheet) with client names, deliverables, and due dates. Review weekly.
4. If someone is repeatedly late, have a direct conversation: "We need [X] by [date] to hit the client deadline. What's getting in the way?" Fix process or capacity; if it's a fit issue, consider changing the role or the person.

**Prevention:** Onboard team/contractors with the same rigor as clients: role, handoffs, and where to find deadlines. Update the one-pager when you add clients or change scope.

**When to escalate:** If the team is consistently unable to deliver despite clear roles and capacity, revisit structure (e.g. hire, change scope, or simplify offerings).

## Partnerships and Referrals

### Issue: Partner sends leads that aren't a fit

**Causes:** You didn't clearly define ideal client or referral criteria; partner is sending everyone; no feedback loop.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Send a short "ideal client" note to the partner: "We're best fit for [industry/size/goals]. Leads that are [X] are usually not a fit. Here are 2–3 examples of great fits." See [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md).
2. When you get a bad-fit lead, reply to the partner (politely): "Thanks for thinking of us. This one isn't quite our niche—we're focused on [X]. If you see [ideal client type], we'd love that intro."
3. Track referrals (source, outcome) as in [Partnership & Outreach Strategies](social-media-level-3-partnership-outreach-strategies.md). If one partner sends only bad-fit leads after 2–3 tries, invest less there and focus on partners who send the right fit.

**Prevention:** At the start of the partnership, share ideal client and referral criteria. Repeat once or twice a year.

**When to escalate:** If a partner gets upset when you decline leads or insists you take every referral, consider whether the partnership is still mutually beneficial. It's okay to step back.

### Issue: Referral agreement is unclear or partner wants a different fee

**Causes:** Verbal agreement only; different expectations on fee, exclusivity, or handoff.

**Step-by-step resolution:**
1. Write down what you agreed: who refers whom, fee (or no fee), how to refer, and any exclusivity. Email it: "Quick summary of how we'll work together: [bullet points]. Does this match your understanding?"
2. If you never agreed and they're asking for a fee: decide what you're willing to pay (e.g. 10% of first 3 months, or one-time). Propose it in writing. If they want more, negotiate or politely decline and keep the relationship informal (no formal referral deal).
3. If you already have a written agreement and one side wants to change it: "Let's update our agreement. I'm thinking [X]. What do you prefer?" Get the new terms in writing (email is fine).

**Prevention:** Always summarize referral terms in writing (email or 1-pager) before sending or receiving leads. See [Partnership & Outreach Strategies](social-media-level-3-partnership-outreach-strategies.md).

**When to escalate:** If the dispute is about money already earned (e.g. they say you owe a fee you didn't agree to), consider legal advice. For future deals, just clarify in writing and move on.
