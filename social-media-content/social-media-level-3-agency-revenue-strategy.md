# Agency Revenue Strategy

How to plan and scale agency revenue so you can reach $3,000–$10,000+/month.

## Purpose

A clear revenue strategy (revenue mix, when to scale, pricing, team cost) keeps your agency profitable as you add clients and team. For Level 3, this guide helps you decide how much to charge, when to raise prices, when to hire or use contractors, and how to track revenue and costs. Use with the [Agency Budget Planning](social-media-level-3-agency-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section. Expected revenue: $3,000–$10,000+/month; platform costs: $100–300/month; time investment: 8–12 weeks for Level 3.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes initial; 30 minutes monthly review  
- **When:** Use at the start of Level 3 and monthly with the [Agency Budget Planning](social-media-level-3-agency-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF). Align with [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft a "when to scale" decision tree or revenue targets from your fill-ins; then personalize.

## Part 1: Revenue Mix

### Where your revenue comes from

**Retainers (monthly recurring):** _________________________________________________  
**Projects (one-off or launch):** _________________________________________________  
**Add-ons (ads, extra channels, strategy calls):** _________________________________________________

**Target split (e.g. 80% retainer, 20% add-ons):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "80% retainer, 15% add-ons (ads, extra channel), 5% projects (launch support). We want most revenue predictable."

## Part 2: When to Scale

### Triggers for raising prices or adding capacity

**Raise prices when:** _________________________________________________  
(E.g. 90% capacity; 6+ months with same clients; new proof points or case studies.)

**Add contractor or hire when:** _________________________________________________  
(E.g. consistent overflow; revenue supports 1.5x current cost; quality slipping.)

**Reduce client count when:** _________________________________________________  
(E.g. burning out; delivery slipping; need to focus on higher-ticket clients.)

**Example:** "Raise prices at renewal when we've added a case study or 6 months have passed. Add a contractor when we're at 5 clients and pipeline has 2 more. Don't add clients past 7 until we have a part-time content person."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Scaling triggers documented; [ ] Reviewed monthly with budget (see Part 4)

## Part 3: Pricing and Team Cost

### Pricing floor and team cost

**Minimum retainer (below this we don't take a client):** $_________  
**Target average revenue per client:** $_________  
**Platform costs (total per month):** $_________ (Level 3 range: $100–300)  
**Team/contractor cost (if any) per month:** $_________

**Rule of thumb:** Revenue should cover platform + team + your salary/take-home + margin. If team cost goes up, revenue per client or client count must go up. Use [Agency Budget Planning](social-media-level-3-agency-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF) for P&L-style summary and cash flow.

**Example:** "Minimum retainer $800. Target average $1,400/client. Platform $200/month. Contractor $800/month. So we need at least 3–4 clients at target average to cover fixed costs and pay ourselves."

## Part 4: Monthly Review

### What to check every month

- [ ] **Revenue:** Total revenue vs last month and vs target ($3k–$10k+ band). Use [Agency Budget Planning](social-media-level-3-agency-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF).
- [ ] **Costs:** Platform, team, other. Are they in line with budget?
- [ ] **Pipeline:** How many leads, from where (partnerships, inbound, cold). Double down on what works. See [Partnership & Outreach Strategies](social-media-level-3-partnership-outreach-strategies.md).
- [ ] **Pricing:** Any client at or below minimum retainer? Plan a conversation at renewal or when scope has grown.
- [ ] **Capacity:** Are we at 90%+ capacity? If yes, trigger "when to scale" (raise prices or add help). See Part 2.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Monthly review on calendar; [ ] Revenue and costs tracked in Agency Budget Planning (PDF)
