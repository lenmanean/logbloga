# Agency Operations Framework

Guided exercises to run agency operations so you can deliver at scale and reach $3,000–$10,000+/month.

## Purpose

A clear operations framework (positioning, offer, client lifecycle, team, systems) keeps your agency consistent and scalable. For Level 3, defining how you position, onboard, deliver, and renew—plus tools and reporting—supports a lean team and $3,000–$10,000+/month. Without it, you'll mix positioning, underdeliver, or burn out as you add clients and team.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 60–90 minutes  
- **When:** Use at the start of Level 3 (Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](social-media-level-3-plan.md)); align with [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md), [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md), and [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft a positioning statement or client lifecycle one-pager from your fill-ins; then personalize.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers with the [Hootsuite Setup Guide](hootsuite-setup-guide.md), [Advanced Analytics Setup](advanced-analytics-setup.md), and [Team Management Templates](team-management-templates.zip) (ZIP) from the Templates section.

## Part 1: Positioning and Offer (Fill-In)

### Who you serve and what you offer

**One-line positioning (who you serve + what you do):**
_________________________________________________

**Ideal client (industry, size, goals):**
_________________________________________________

**Core offer (e.g. full-service social, content + ads, community + reporting):**
_________________________________________________

**What makes you different (e.g. niche, speed, white-label, reporting):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "We serve B2B SaaS and professional services with full-service social (content, scheduling, reporting). We're different: monthly strategy call + custom dashboards and fast turnaround."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Positioning and offer documented; [ ] Used in [Agency Positioning Guide](social-media-level-3-agency-positioning-guide.md) and proposals

## Part 2: Client Lifecycle (Onboard, Deliver, Renew)

### How you onboard, deliver, and renew

**Onboard (steps and tools):**
- Kickoff: _________________________________________________
- Access and brand: _________________________________________________
- First content and report date: _________________________________________________
- Tools (e.g. [Client Onboarding Checklist](client-onboarding-checklist.pdf), [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template.xlsx) (XLSX)): _________________________________________________

**Deliver (ongoing):**
- Content cadence: _________________________________________________
- Scheduling tool (e.g. [Hootsuite](hootsuite-setup-guide.md)): _________________________________________________
- Reporting cadence and template (e.g. [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) (DOCX)): _________________________________________________

**Renew (retention):**
- How you check in (e.g. quarterly review, monthly report call): _________________________________________________
- How you upsell or extend (e.g. add channels, ads): _________________________________________________

**Example:** "Onboard: kickoff call + access form + Client Onboarding Checklist; first report in 30 days. Deliver: 5 posts/week per client via Hootsuite; monthly PDF report. Renew: quarterly strategy call; offer ads or extra channels as add-on."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Client lifecycle documented; [ ] Onboard/deliver/renew clear for team and clients

## Part 3: Team and Roles (If Any)

### Who does what (solo or team)

**Current setup (solo / 1–2 contractors / small team):**
_________________________________________________

**Roles (e.g. strategy, content, scheduling, reporting, account lead):**
_________________________________________________

**Approval flow (who approves posts or reports before client):**
_________________________________________________

**Handoffs (e.g. content creator → scheduler → approver):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Solo for now; contractor for design. I do strategy, scheduling, and reporting; contractor delivers assets. No formal approval; I review before publish. Use [Team Management Templates](team-management-templates.zip) (ZIP) when we add a second full-time person."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Roles and approval flow documented; [ ] Team templates in use if team exists

---

## Part 4: Systems (Tools, Reporting)

### What you use and how you report

**Scheduling:** _________________________________________________ (e.g. [Hootsuite](hootsuite-setup-guide.md))  
**Analytics / reporting:** _________________________________________________ (e.g. [Advanced Analytics](advanced-analytics-setup.md))  
**Content calendar:** _________________________________________________ (e.g. XLSX, Notion, Airtable)  
**Client communication:** _________________________________________________ (e.g. email, Slack, project tool)  
**Contracts and billing:** _________________________________________________ (e.g. Hello Bonsai, Stripe)

**Reporting (what clients get and how often):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Scheduling: Hootsuite. Analytics: GA4 + Metricool + monthly PDF from our template. Calendar: Content Calendar XLSX per client. Communication: email + monthly call. Billing: Hello Bonsai. Clients get monthly PDF report + 1-page summary and optional 30-min call."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Systems list complete; [ ] Reporting cadence and format clear; [ ] Aligned with [Agency Revenue Strategy](social-media-level-3-agency-revenue-strategy.md) and [Agency Budget Planning](social-media-level-3-agency-budget-planning.pdf) (PDF)
