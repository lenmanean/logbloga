# Buffer Paid Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for setting up Buffer's paid tier so you can manage multiple clients and scale your SMM service—supporting $1,000–$3,000/month.

## Overview

Buffer's paid tiers add more channels, more queued posts, and (on higher tiers) team and client management. For Level 2 SMM, you need a paid tier that supports multiple clients or channels, a clear queue per client, and (optional) approval workflow. This guide walks you through upgrading to paid, setting up team/client structure, queue per client, and approval workflow—within Level 2 time investment (4–6 weeks) and platform costs ($30–100/month).

## Prerequisites

- [Buffer](buffer-setup-guide.md) account (Level 1 guide) or equivalent
- Decision to use Buffer for multi-client (you may use Later instead; both are valid)
- Client accounts or channels to manage
- [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) and [Service Portfolio Checklist](social-media-level-2-service-portfolio-checklist.md) in progress

**Time:** About 25–40 minutes total (upgrade and structure ~15 min; queue and workflow ~10–25 min).

## Step 1: Upgrade to Paid Tier

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Choose a Buffer plan that supports multiple channels and (if needed) team/client structure.

### Sub-steps

1. In Buffer, go to **Account** or **Billing** (or **Upgrade**). Compare **plans**: Free vs Pro vs Premium (or current naming). For SMM with 3–5 clients, you typically need at least the tier that allows multiple channels (e.g. 8–10 channels) and more queued posts per channel.
2. **Select plan:** Choose the plan that fits your client count. If you manage one channel per client (e.g. Client A – Instagram, Client B – Instagram), count 1 channel per client. If you manage multiple channels per client (e.g. Instagram + Facebook per client), multiply accordingly.
3. **Payment:** Enter payment details and confirm. Buffer will upgrade your account; you may need to reconnect channels if limits change.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Paid tier active; [ ] Channel limit supports your client count; [ ] Queued posts limit sufficient for your cadence

## Step 2: Set Up Team/Client Structure

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Organize channels by client so you don't mix content and can report per client.

### Sub-steps

1. **Channels:** In Buffer, go to **Channels** (or **Accounts**). Add or connect each client's social account (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc.). Name each channel clearly (e.g. "Client A – Instagram," "Client B – Facebook").
2. **Publishing access:** If you have a team (or plan to), invite members and set permissions (e.g. only you can publish, or team can draft and you approve). For solo SMM, you may not need this yet.
3. **Client naming:** Use a consistent naming convention (Client name + platform) so when you switch between queues or calendars, you know whose content you're editing.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] All client channels added and named; [ ] No mix-up between clients when scheduling

## Step 3: Queue Per Client and Approval Workflow

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up a queue (or calendar) per client and (optional) approval so content goes out correctly.

### Sub-step 3.1: Queue per client

1. In Buffer, go to **Queue** (or **Publishing** > **Queue**). Select one **channel** (one client). Add posts to that channel's queue with the right cadence (e.g. 5 posts per week for that client). Repeat for each client channel.
2. **Best times:** Set best times per channel if Buffer supports it (different clients may have different audiences and best times). Use [Metricool](metricool-setup-guide.md) or platform insights to inform times.
3. **Content Calendar Template:** Use the [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template.xlsx) (XLSX) from the Templates section to plan by client, date, platform, content type, copy, status—then add to Buffer in batch.

### Sub-step 3.2: Approval workflow (optional)

1. If your plan includes **approval workflow**, enable it so posts go to a "pending" state until you (or the client) approve. This is useful if clients want to review before publish.
2. **Alternative:** If Buffer doesn't offer approval, send clients a weekly preview (e.g. PDF or link) of scheduled posts for sign-off before they go live. Document this in your [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) Part 4 (reporting and approval).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Queue (or calendar) set per client; [ ] At least one week of content queued for one client; [ ] Approval workflow or preview process clear (if required)

## What You'll Have When Done

A Buffer paid account with multiple client channels, a queue (or calendar) per client, and (optional) approval or preview process. Use the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) and [Service Portfolio Checklist](social-media-level-2-service-portfolio-checklist.md) for onboarding and positioning. See the [Later Setup Guide](later-setup-guide.md) and [Metricool Setup Guide](metricool-setup-guide.md) for calendar and reporting. If you run into client or service issues, use [Client & Service Issues](social-media-level-2-client-service-issues.md).
