# Client & Service Issues (Level 2)

Common client and service issues for SMM. For each issue: causes, step-by-step resolution, prevention, and when to escalate.

---

## 1. Scope and Deliverables

**Issue:** Client asks for more than agreed (extra posts, new channel, ads) or disputes what was delivered.

### Causes

- Scope not defined in writing (no contract or proposal with clear deliverables).  
- No revision or add-on policy so client assumes unlimited changes or extra work.  
- Client goals changed mid-month and they expect more without paying more.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Refer to the agreement.** If you have a proposal or contract (see [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md)), point to the scope: channels, posts per week, reporting, revisions. "Per our agreement, this package includes [X]. Additional [Y] would be an add-on at [price]."
2. **Define scope in writing for new clients.** Use the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) and a simple service agreement: deliverables (channels, posts, report), revision round (e.g. 1 per month), add-ons (extra post $X, new channel $Y). Send before starting.
3. **Offer a clear add-on path.** If the client wants more, offer a paid add-on (e.g. "5 extra posts for $X" or "Add TikTok for $Y/month") or a new scope document (amendment). Don't do unlimited extra work for free.
4. **Document.** Keep a record of what was agreed (email or contract) and what was delivered (content calendar, report links) so you have proof if disputed.

### Prevention

- Use the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) and a written agreement for every new client.  
- Set revision count (e.g. 1 round per month) and state what's out of scope (e.g. "Ads management is add-on").  
- Review scope in the kickoff email and in the first report so the client sees what's included.

### When to escalate

- **Payment dispute:** If the client refuses to pay for delivered work, respond with proof (agreement, deliverables, messages). Escalate to small claims or a lawyer if they still refuse.  
- **Contract breach:** If the client breaches the contract (e.g. non-payment, misuse of content), document and consider terminating per your agreement (e.g. 30-day notice).

## 2. Client Communication

**Issue:** Client doesn't respond in time, or expectations on response time and updates don't match.

### Causes

- No set expectation for response time (you or the client).  
- Updates sent in different channels (email, Slack, WhatsApp) so messages get lost.  
- No regular touchpoint (e.g. monthly call or report) so the client feels out of the loop.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Set response-time expectations.** In onboarding (see [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md)), state how quickly you'll respond (e.g. "I typically respond within 24 hours on weekdays") and ask the client what they prefer. Stick to one primary channel per client (e.g. email or Slack).
2. **Use a regular touchpoint.** Send the monthly report on the same day each month (see [Metricool Setup Guide](metricool-setup-guide.md) and [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx)). Add a short summary and 2–3 recommendations. Optionally offer a 15-min call to walk through the report.
3. **Confirm in writing.** When the client requests a change (e.g. new pillar, new channel), confirm in writing (email): "Just to confirm: we're adding [X] starting [date]. This will be [included / add-on $Y]." Avoid "he said she said" later.
4. **Catch up if you missed a message.** If you missed a message, apologize briefly, answer the question, and confirm the primary channel going forward.

### Prevention

- Include response-time and primary channel in onboarding (Client Onboarding Framework).  
- Block time in your calendar for client communication (e.g. 30 min morning).  
- Send reports on a set schedule (e.g. 5th of each month) so the client knows when to expect updates.

### When to escalate

- **Client unreachable:** If the client goes silent for 2+ weeks and you've sent 2–3 follow-ups, document it (messages, dates) and consider pausing delivery until they respond. Use your contract terms (e.g. 30-day notice to terminate) if needed.  
- **Abuse or harassment:** If the client is abusive or threatening, document and terminate per your agreement. Do not continue until the situation is resolved.

## 3. Multi-Client Capacity

**Issue:** You're overloaded—too many clients or too much content—and quality or deadlines slip.

### Causes

- No capacity plan (how many clients or posts you can handle per week).  
- Saying yes to every new client without checking capacity.  
- No batching or scheduling so you're creating content in real time every day.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Use a capacity plan.** Use the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) and [SMM Budget Planner](social-media-level-2-smm-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF). How many clients can you serve at once? How many posts per week can you create and schedule? Set a max (e.g. 3 clients, 20 posts/week total) and don't exceed it until you've streamlined (templates, AI, or help).
2. **Batch and schedule.** Use the [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template.xlsx) (XLSX) and [Later](later-setup-guide.md) or [Buffer](buffer-paid-setup-guide.md) to plan and schedule 1–2 weeks ahead. Block 2–3 content batch sessions per week so you're not creating ad hoc every day.
3. **Say no or delay.** If a new prospect wants to start and you're at capacity, say: "I'm at capacity until [date]. I can start then, or I can add you to a waitlist." Don't overcommit and then miss deadlines.
4. **Communicate early if you'll miss a deadline.** If you see a deadline slipping, message the client immediately: "I'm going to need 1–2 extra days for [deliverable]. I'll deliver by [new date]. Apologies for the delay." Don't wait until the last day.

### Prevention

- Review capacity weekly: how many clients, how many posts due, how many hours left. Use the SMM Budget Planner to track revenue and capacity.  
- Before saying yes to a new client, check your calendar and content batch. If you're full, say no or propose a later start date.  
- Use the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) to set realistic cadence (e.g. 5 posts/week per client, not 10) so you can deliver consistently.

### When to escalate

- **Client demands impossible deadline:** If the client insists on a deadline you can't meet, offer a realistic date or decline. Don't overcommit and then miss.  
- **Burnout:** If you're consistently overloaded, reduce clients (e.g. don't renew one), raise rates (see [Service Pricing Strategy](social-media-level-2-service-pricing-strategy.md)), or get help (VA, freelancer) before adding more.

## 4. Billing and Contracts

**Issue:** Client pays late, disputes an invoice, or wants to change payment terms mid-contract.

### Causes

- Payment terms not in writing (due date, method, late fee).  
- No contract or unclear termination so the client stops paying but expects work to continue.  
- Scope creep (client expects more) and they don't want to pay add-ons.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Refer to the contract.** Point to payment terms: due date (e.g. 1st of month), method (e.g. bank transfer, PayPal), late fee (if any). "Per our agreement, payment is due by [date]. I haven't received payment for [month]. Please send by [date] or we'll need to pause delivery."
2. **Send invoices on time.** Use Hello Bonsai, Stripe, or a simple invoice template. Send the invoice 5–7 days before the due date so the client has time to pay. Set a reminder to follow up if unpaid by due date.
3. **Get scope and payment in writing for new clients.** Use the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) and a simple service agreement: scope, fee, payment terms, length, termination (e.g. 30-day notice). Signed before starting.
4. **Pause delivery if unpaid.** If the client is 2+ weeks late and hasn't communicated, pause delivery (no new posts, no report) until payment is received. Document this in your contract so you're not in breach.

### Prevention

- Use a written agreement for every client (scope, fee, payment terms, termination).  
- Send invoices on a set schedule (e.g. 1st of month for that month, or end of prior month).  
- Use the [SMM Budget Planner](social-media-level-2-smm-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) to track income and follow up on missing payments.

### When to escalate

- **Non-payment:** If the client refuses to pay after 2+ reminders and you have proof of delivery, send a final notice and consider small claims or a lawyer.  
- **Contract change:** If the client wants to change payment terms or scope mid-contract, put the change in writing (amendment or new agreement) and get both parties to sign. Don't rely on verbal agreement.
