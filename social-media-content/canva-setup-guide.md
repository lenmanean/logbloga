# Canva Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for setting up Canva so you can create on-brand visuals and use AI features for content—supporting $300–$1,000/month as a personal brand or content creator.

## Overview

Canva is a design tool for creating graphics, templates, and short-form video. For Level 1 personal brand monetization, consistent visuals (colors, fonts, style) help you look professional and recognizable. Canva's brand kit, templates, and AI features (Magic Design, text-to-image where available) speed up creation. This guide walks you through account creation, brand kit setup, templates, AI features, and export for social—within Level 1 time investment (2–3 weeks) and platform costs ($0–30/month). Canva has a free tier; Pro adds more brand kits, templates, and AI.

## Prerequisites

- Email address (or Google/Apple sign-in)
- Brand direction: colors, fonts, one-liner (use the [Brand Identity Framework](brand-identity-framework.md) in this level if needed)
- Optional: ChatGPT or Claude for caption or hook ideas to pair with visuals

**Time:** About 30–45 minutes total (account and brand kit ~15 min; templates and first design ~20–30 min).

## Step 1: Create Account and Set Up Brand Kit

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a Canva account and set up your brand kit (colors, fonts) so all designs stay consistent.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [canva.com](https://www.canva.com) and click **Sign up** or **Get started**. Sign up with **email**, **Google**, or **Apple**.
2. Choose **For work** or **For personal use** (either works for Level 1). You can create a **Team** later if you move to Level 2 and work with clients.
3. **Brand Kit:** Go to **Brand** (or **Brand kit** in the sidebar). If you're on Canva Pro, you can create a full Brand Kit; on Free, use **Colors** and **Fonts** in the design editor.
   - **Colors:** Add 2–4 brand colors (hex codes from your [Brand Identity Framework](brand-identity-framework.md) Part 2). Use one primary, one secondary, and one accent.
   - **Fonts:** Add 1–2 brand fonts (e.g. one for headings, one for body). Canva Free has a limited set; Pro unlocks more. Pick fonts that match your voice (e.g. professional vs playful).
4. **Logo (optional):** If you have a logo, upload it to Brand Kit or save it in a project and reuse. If not, use a simple text-based "logo" (your name or handle in your brand font) for Level 1.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Canva account created; [ ] Brand colors and fonts set; [ ] Ready to use in templates

## Step 2: Find and Save Templates for Your Content Formats

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Save 2–3 templates that match your content pillars and formats so you can create quickly.

### Sub-steps

1. In Canva, go to **Templates** (or search from the home screen). Search by **platform** (e.g. "Instagram post," "Instagram Reel," "TikTok," "YouTube thumbnail") and by **style** (e.g. "minimal," "bold," "carousel").
2. **Pick 2–3 templates** that fit your [Brand Identity Framework](brand-identity-framework.md) (visual style) and [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) (formats: reels, carousels, etc.). Click **Use template** to open a copy; then **File** > **Save as template** (or add to a folder) so you can reuse.
3. **Customize once:** Change the template to your brand colors and fonts (use the Brand Kit). Replace the sample text with your headline or hook. Save as your "master" so future posts are just duplicate + edit.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] 2–3 templates saved; [ ] Brand colors and fonts applied; [ ] Ready for weekly content batch

## Step 3: Use AI Features (Magic Design, Text-to-Image)

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes to try  
**Purpose:** Use Canva AI to speed up design and idea generation where it fits your voice.

### Sub-step 3.1: Magic Design

1. **Magic Design:** In Canva, use **Create a design** and type a description (e.g. "Instagram carousel about productivity tips"). Canva may suggest layouts. Pick one and customize with your brand kit and copy.
2. **Magic Write:** In text boxes, you can use **Magic Write** (Pro) or similar to expand a short hook into a caption. Always edit for your voice and platform (e.g. shorten for Instagram caption).

### Sub-step 3.2: Text-to-image (if available)

1. In the editor, add an **element** or search **Apps** for **Text to Image** or **DALL·E** (if your plan includes it). Enter a prompt (e.g. "minimal illustration of [topic] in [your style]") and generate. Use generated images as backgrounds or graphics; add your own text and branding on top.
2. **Best practice:** Don't rely on AI images alone—mix with your own photos, screenshots, or simple graphics so your content stays recognizable and compliant with platform policies.

**AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to write 3–5 image prompts for your pillars; then paste into Canva Text to Image and pick the best result. Tweak for your brand.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Magic Design or templates used for at least one post; [ ] Text-to-image tried (if available); [ ] One post fully designed and exported

## Step 4: Export for Social

**Time:** ~5 minutes per design  
**Purpose:** Export in the right size and format for each platform so your posts look correct.

### Sub-steps

1. **Size:** Before exporting, set the correct dimensions (e.g. Instagram post 1080×1080, Reel 1080×1920, TikTok 1080×1920). Canva templates often have these; otherwise **Resize** (Pro) or create a new design with the right dimensions.
2. **Export:** Click **Share** > **Download**. Choose **PNG** or **JPG** for images; **MP4** for video. Select quality (e.g. Standard or High for social).
3. **Use in Buffer:** Upload the exported file to [Buffer](buffer-setup-guide.md) (or your scheduler) with your caption. Or post directly to the platform if you prefer.

**What you'll have when done:** A Canva account with brand kit (colors, fonts), 2–3 saved templates aligned with your content direction, and at least one post designed and exported. Use the [Brand Identity Framework](brand-identity-framework.md) and [Content Strategy Template](content-strategy-template.xlsx) (XLSX) for consistency. See the [Content Direction Framework](content-direction-framework.md) for formats and cadence.
