# Client Reporting Template — Content Specification

This file is the **content specification** for the DOCX **Client Reporting Template** (Level 2). Use it to create or regenerate the document so the structure stays consistent with the package. Terminology follows [TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md](../docs/TERMINOLOGY_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

**Level 2 context:** Social media management service; time investment 4–6 weeks; expected revenue $1,000–$3,000/month.

## Document Structure

**Purpose:** Deliver clear, repeatable client reports so you can demonstrate value and support [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) and renewals. Use with [Metricool](metricool-setup-guide.md) for data and [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) for reporting cadence.

### Section 1: Summary

**Instructions:** One short paragraph (2–4 sentences) summarizing the reporting period.

- **Include:** Time period, main wins (e.g. reach up, engagement up), one highlight (e.g. top post or campaign).
- **Tone:** Professional, outcome-focused. Avoid jargon unless the client uses it.

### Section 2: Metrics

**Instructions:** Key numbers in a simple table or bullet list.

- **Suggested columns/rows:** Reach, impressions, engagement rate, followers (net change), clicks (if tracked), other KPIs agreed in onboarding.
- **Compare:** Period-over-period (e.g. vs. last month) where possible.
- **Source:** Pull from [Metricool](metricool-setup-guide.md) or native platform exports; cite data source in a footnote if needed.

### Section 3: Top Posts

**Instructions:** Showcase 3–5 top-performing posts from the period.

- **Include:** Platform, date, content type, brief description or caption snippet, and 1–2 metrics (e.g. reach, likes, comments).
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate what’s working and inform future content.

### Section 4: Recommendations

**Instructions:** 2–4 actionable next steps.

- **Include:** What to do next (e.g. double down on reels, test a new format, adjust posting times), and why (tied to metrics or goals).
- **Optional:** Link to [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template-spec.md) or next month’s focus.
