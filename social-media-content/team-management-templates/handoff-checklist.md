# Handoff Checklist

Use when closing a phase, project, or client engagement so nothing is dropped and the next owner (or client) has a clear picture. Align with [Team Roles and Workflows](team-roles-and-workflows.md) handoff steps.

---

## Before handoff

- [ ] **Deliverables:** All agreed deliverables for this phase/project are complete and approved.
- [ ] **Client sign-off:** Client has confirmed acceptance (email, form, or call note).
- [ ] **Final report or summary:** If applicable, final report or wrap-up summary sent to client.
- [ ] **Assets and access:** Any client assets or logins are returned or documented (per contract).

## Handoff steps

- [ ] **Tasks closed:** All tasks for this phase/project are marked complete in your task tool (ClickUp, Asana, etc.).
- [ ] **Next phase or renewal:** If there is a next phase or renewal, date and owner are set; client knows what to expect.
- [ ] **Knowledge transfer:** If handing off to another team member, key context (goals, history, quirks) is documented or passed in a call.
- [ ] **Billing and contracts:** Invoices for this phase are sent/paid; contract or SOW is updated if needed.

## After handoff

- [ ] **Archive or file:** Project/phase folder or client file is archived or filed so it's findable later.
- [ ] **Retro (optional):** Quick note on what went well and what to improve for next time.
