# Team Management Templates

Ready-to-use templates for running team operations in a **Level 3 social media agency**. Use these with the [Agency Operations Framework](../agency-operations-framework.md) and [Service Suite Development](../service-suite-development.md) so roles, kickoff, status, and handoff stay consistent as you scale.

## What's in this pack

- **team-roles-and-workflows.md** — Define who does strategy, content, scheduling, reporting, and client comms; approval flow and handoffs.
- **kickoff-agenda.md** — One-page agenda for client kickoff: intro, roles, scope, first deliverables, Q&A.
- **status-report-template.md** — Biweekly or monthly internal status: deliverables, metrics, blockers, next 2 weeks.
- **handoff-checklist.md** — Checklist for phase or project handoff: deliverables approved, sign-off, next phase, tasks closed.

## How to use

1. Complete [Agency Operations Framework](../agency-operations-framework.md) Part 3 (Team and Roles) so you know who does what.
2. Customize each template with your agency name, roles, and tools (e.g. Hootsuite, Metricool).
3. Use kickoff-agenda for every new client; use status-report for internal sync; use handoff-checklist when closing a phase or project.
4. Align with your [Service Suite Development](../service-suite-development.md) tiers and deliverables.
