# Team Roles and Workflows

Define who does what in your social media agency so delivery stays consistent and handoffs are clear. Align with [Agency Operations Framework](../agency-operations-framework.md) Part 3 and your [Hootsuite](../hootsuite-setup-guide.md) (or scheduler) team setup.

## Role definitions

Fill in for your agency. Adjust titles to match your structure (solo, contractors, small team).

| Role | Who | Responsibilities |
|------|-----|------------------|
| **Strategy / Account lead** | | Client goals, content direction, reporting cadence, renewal conversations. |
| **Content creator** | | Create posts (copy, visuals); use Content Direction Framework and brand kit. |
| **Scheduler** | | Queue posts in Hootsuite/Later/Buffer; assign to correct profiles; respect approval flow. |
| **Approver** | | Review posts or reports before client; ensure brand and quality. |
| **Reporting** | | Pull metrics, draft client report using [Client Reporting Template](../client-reporting-template-spec.md); send on cadence. |

## Approval flow

- **Who approves posts before they go live?** (e.g. account lead, client, or no formal approval)
- **Who approves reports before they go to the client?**
- **Turnaround time:** e.g. 24 hours for post approval; same day for report review.

## Handoffs

- **Content creator → Scheduler:** Content ready (copy + asset); scheduler queues and sets time.
- **Scheduler → Approver (if used):** Posts in "pending" until approver signs off.
- **Reporting → Account lead:** Draft report; account lead reviews and sends to client.
- **Phase or project end:** Use [handoff-checklist.md](handoff-checklist.md) so nothing is dropped.

## Example (solo + contractor)

- **You:** Strategy, scheduling, reporting, client comms. You approve your own posts or client approves.
- **Contractor:** Content creation (design, copy, or both). Delivers assets; you queue and publish.
- **Handoff:** Contractor delivers batch by [date]; you queue in Hootsuite and send client report monthly.

## Testing checklist

- [ ] Roles documented and shared with team (if any).
- [ ] Approval flow matches Hootsuite (or your tool) settings.
- [ ] Handoff steps and timing are clear so deliverables are never stuck.
