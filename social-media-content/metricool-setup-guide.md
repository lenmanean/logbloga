# Metricool Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for setting up Metricool so you can track analytics and create reports for clients—supporting $1,000–$3,000/month as a social media management service.

## Overview

Metricool is an analytics and reporting tool for social media. For Level 2 SMM, you need to connect client profiles, set up dashboards and reports, and (optionally) white-label so reports look professional. This guide walks you through account creation, connecting profiles, dashboards, reports, and white-label—within Level 2 time investment (4–6 weeks) and platform costs ($30–100/month).

## Prerequisites

- Email address (or social login)
- Client social accounts (or your own for testing) to connect
- Reporting cadence defined (use the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) in this level)
- Optional: [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) (DOCX) from the Templates section

**Time:** About 35–50 minutes total (account and connect ~15 min; dashboards and reports ~20–35 min).

## Step 1: Create Account and Connect Profiles

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a Metricool account and connect the social profiles you'll report on (yours or clients') so you can pull metrics.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [metricool.com](https://metricool.com) (or your region's URL) and click **Sign Up** or **Get Started**. Sign up with **email** or **social login** (e.g. Google, Facebook).
2. Choose your **plan** (Metricool has free and paid tiers; for SMM with multiple clients and reporting, a paid tier is typically needed). Select the plan that fits your profile count and reporting needs (e.g. 3–5 profiles, PDF reports).
3. **Connect profiles:** Click **Add Account** or **Connect** and follow the prompts to connect Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or Google Analytics. You may need to log in to each platform and authorize Metricool. For client accounts, use their login or request access (e.g. Facebook Business Manager, Instagram Business/Creator).
4. **Verify:** After connecting, confirm each profile appears in your Metricool dashboard and data is syncing. If a connection fails, check platform permissions and re-authorize.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Metricool account created; [ ] At least one profile connected; [ ] Data syncing (may take a few hours for first sync)

## Step 2: Set Up Dashboards and Reports

**Time:** ~20–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create dashboards and reports so you can show clients reach, engagement, and top content.

### Sub-step 2.1: Dashboards

1. In Metricool, go to **Dashboard** or **Analytics**. Select a **profile** (or client). View key metrics: followers, reach, engagement, top posts, best times.
2. **Customize:** If Metricool allows custom dashboards, add the metrics that matter for each client (e.g. reach, engagement rate, link clicks, saves). Use the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) and client goals to decide what to track.
3. **Multi-client:** Switch between profiles to see each client's dashboard. Bookmark or name them clearly (e.g. "Client A – Instagram").

### Sub-step 2.2: Reports

1. Go to **Reports** (or **Create Report**). Choose **PDF** or **Link** report. Select the **profile(s)** and **date range** (e.g. last 30 days).
2. **Sections:** Include summary, key metrics (followers, reach, engagement), top posts (screenshots or links), and recommendations. Align with the [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) (DOCX) from the Templates section: summary, metrics, top posts, recommendations.
3. **Schedule (optional):** If Metricool supports scheduled reports, set a monthly (or weekly) report to be generated and sent to you or the client. This saves time and keeps reporting consistent.

### Sub-step 2.3: White-label (optional)

1. If your plan includes **white-label**, add your logo and brand colors to the report so it looks like it comes from you, not Metricool. This is optional but professional for Level 2.
2. **Branding:** Add your business name, logo, and (optional) contact info to the report header or footer.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Dashboard in use for at least one profile; [ ] At least one report generated (PDF or link); [ ] Report sections match Client Reporting Template structure; [ ] White-label applied (if available)

## Step 3: Integrate with Client Onboarding and Reporting Cadence

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Use Metricool as part of your client onboarding and reporting workflow.

### Sub-steps

1. **Onboarding:** When you onboard a new client (see [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md)), add their profiles to Metricool and set the reporting cadence (e.g. monthly report by the 5th). Document in the [Client Onboarding Checklist](client-onboarding-checklist.pdf) (PDF) from the Templates section.
2. **Reporting cadence:** Send reports on the same day each month (or week) so clients know when to expect them. Use the Client Reporting Template (DOCX) for narrative (summary, recommendations); use Metricool for metrics and top posts.
3. **Review:** In client calls or emails, walk through the report: what worked, what to do more of, what to test. Use the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) and [Service Pricing Strategy](social-media-level-2-service-pricing-strategy.md) to tie results to value (e.g. "Reach up 20%; we'll keep this format for next month").

**What you'll have when done:** A Metricool account with connected profiles, dashboards and reports in place, and a clear reporting cadence for clients. Use the [Client Reporting Template](client-reporting-template.docx) (DOCX) and [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) for consistency. See the [Service Pricing Framework](service-pricing-framework.md) for pricing and the [Client & Service Issues](social-media-level-2-client-service-issues.md) guide if reporting or scope issues arise.
