# Content Direction Framework

Guided exercises to define what you post, in what formats, how often, and what you measure—so you can build a content system that supports $300–$1,000/month as a personal brand or content creator.

## Purpose

A clear content direction (pillars, formats, cadence, metrics) keeps you from posting randomly and helps you plan a week or month in advance. Consistency in themes and formats builds audience and supports monetization. Without it, you run out of ideas and analytics don't tell you what to do more of.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes  
- **When:** Complete after [Niche Selection Worksheet](niche-selection-worksheet.md) and [Brand Identity Framework](brand-identity-framework.md) (Phase 2 of the [Implementation Plan](social-media-level-1-plan.md)); before filling the Content Strategy Template and first posts.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to brainstorm content pillars ("What content pillars do [niche] creators use?") and post ideas; then pick what fits you.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in the [Content Strategy Template](content-strategy-template.xlsx) (XLSX), [Daily Posting Checklist](daily-posting-checklist.pdf) (PDF), and [Buffer Setup Guide](buffer-setup-guide.md).

## Part 1: Content Pillars (3–5 Themes)

### Themes you'll post about regularly

**Pillar 1 (main theme):**
_________________________________________________

**Pillar 2:**
_________________________________________________

**Pillar 3:**
_________________________________________________

**Pillar 4 (optional):**
_________________________________________________

**Pillar 5 (optional):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Pillar 1: Productivity tips. Pillar 2: Tool reviews (Notion, etc.). Pillar 3: Remote work habits. Pillar 4: Behind-the-scenes. Pillar 5: Q&A or community."

**Rule of thumb:** 80% of posts should fit your pillars; 20% can be personal, trends, or experiments.

## Part 2: Formats (Reels, Carousels, Stories, etc.)

### What types of content you'll create

**Primary format(s) for feed (e.g. reels, carousels, single image):**
_________________________________________________

**Secondary format(s):**
_________________________________________________

**Stories or ephemeral (yes/no, how often):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Primary: Reels (3×/week) and carousels (2×/week). Secondary: single image with tip. Stories: daily, behind-the-scenes and polls."

**Match to platform:** Instagram (reels, carousels, stories), TikTok (short video), LinkedIn (carousel, text, video), YouTube (shorts, long-form). Pick 1–2 platforms to start and match formats to what works there.

## Part 3: Cadence and Calendar

### How often you'll post and when

**Posts per week (total across platforms):**
_________________________________________________

**Best times (when your audience is online):**
_________________________________________________

**Content batch day(s) (e.g. Sunday afternoon):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "5 posts per week (3 reels, 2 carousels). Best times: 8am and 6pm. Batch: Sunday 2–4pm for the week."

**Use this in:** [Buffer Setup Guide](buffer-setup-guide.md) (queue and best times) and the Content Strategy Template (XLSX) for planning by date and platform.

## Part 4: Metrics That Matter

### What you'll track to improve

**Reach or impressions (yes/no):**
_________________________________________________

**Engagement (likes, comments, shares, saves):**
_________________________________________________

**Clicks (link in bio, swipe-up):**
_________________________________________________

**Conversions (sign-ups, sales, affiliate clicks):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "I'll track reach and engagement weekly; clicks and conversions monthly. Primary goal: link clicks (affiliate); secondary: saves and shares."

**Use this in:** [Google Analytics Setup Guide](google-analytics-setup-guide.md) (goals/events) and [Content Growth Checklist](social-media-level-1-content-growth-checklist.md) (weekly review). Align with [First Monetization Guide](social-media-level-1-first-monetization-guide.md) (affiliate, sponsored, product).
