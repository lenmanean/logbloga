# Later Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for setting up Later so you can schedule and calendar content for multiple clients—supporting $1,000–$3,000/month as a social media management service.

## Overview

Later is a scheduling and calendar tool for social media. For Level 2 SMM, you need a calendar view, multi-account support, and batch scheduling so you can manage 3–5 clients. This guide walks you through account creation, connecting profiles, calendar view, first batch, and best times—within Level 2 time investment (4–6 weeks) and platform costs ($30–100/month).

## Prerequisites

- Email address (or social login)
- Client social accounts (or your own for testing) to connect
- Content direction or client briefs (use the [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) in this level)
- Optional: ChatGPT or Claude for caption drafts

**Time:** About 30–45 minutes total (account and connect ~15 min; calendar and first batch ~20–30 min).

## Step 1: Create Account and Connect Profiles

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create a Later account and connect the social profiles you'll manage (yours or clients') so you can schedule content.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [later.com](https://later.com) and click **Get Started** or **Sign Up**. Sign up with **email** or **social login** (e.g. Google, Facebook).
2. Choose your **plan** (Later has free and paid tiers; for SMM with multiple clients, a paid tier is typically needed for multiple profiles and calendar view). Select the plan that fits your client count (e.g. 3–5 profiles).
3. **Connect profiles:** Click **Add Social Account** and follow the prompts to connect Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn, or Twitter/X. You may need to log in to each platform and authorize Later. For client accounts, use their login or request access (e.g. Facebook Business Manager, Instagram Business/Creator).
4. **Verify:** After connecting, confirm each profile appears in your Later dashboard. If a connection fails, check platform permissions (e.g. Instagram may require Business or Creator account).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Later account created; [ ] At least one profile connected; [ ] Profile visible in dashboard

## Step 2: Set Up Calendar View and First Batch

**Time:** ~15–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Use the calendar view to plan content by date and add your first batch of posts.

### Sub-step 2.1: Calendar view

1. In Later, go to **Calendar** (or **Content** > **Calendar**). Choose **Month** or **Week** view so you can see posts by date.
2. **Switch between profiles:** Use the profile selector to view and schedule per client (or per channel). This keeps each client's content organized.
3. **Drag and drop:** Later typically allows drag-and-drop to move posts between dates. Use this to balance content across the week.

### Sub-step 2.2: First batch

1. Click **Create Post** (or **Add to Calendar**). Select the **profile(s)** and **date/time**. Write or paste your caption; attach image or video.
2. **Best times:** Use Later's **Best Time to Post** (if available) or your own data from [Metricool](metricool-setup-guide.md) or platform insights to set posting times. For each client, aim for 1–2 times per day (or per client cadence).
3. Add 5–10 posts to fill the first week for one client (or your own test). Use the [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template.xlsx) (XLSX) from the Templates section to plan by client, date, platform, content type, copy, status—then add to Later.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Calendar view in use; [ ] At least 5 posts scheduled for one profile; [ ] Best times or default times set

## Step 3: Workflow for Multiple Clients

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes to set up; ongoing  
**Purpose:** Use Later so each client has a clear queue and you don't mix content.

### Sub-steps

1. **One profile set per client (or per channel):** If you manage multiple accounts, assign each client their own profile set in Later. Name them clearly (e.g. "Client A – Instagram").
2. **Content Calendar Template:** Use the Content Calendar Template (XLSX) or a spreadsheet to plan by client, date, platform, content type, copy, status. Then add posts to Later in batch (e.g. every Sunday for the week).
3. **Approval (optional):** If clients require approval before posting, use Later's approval workflow (if available) or send a weekly preview (e.g. PDF or link) for sign-off before scheduling.

**What you'll have when done:** A Later account with calendar view, at least one profile connected, and a workflow to add content by client. Use the [Content Calendar Template](content-calendar-template.xlsx) (XLSX) and [Client Onboarding Framework](client-onboarding-framework.md) for consistency. See the [Metricool Setup Guide](metricool-setup-guide.md) for reporting and the [Buffer Paid Setup Guide](buffer-paid-setup-guide.md) for multi-client scheduling if you use both.
