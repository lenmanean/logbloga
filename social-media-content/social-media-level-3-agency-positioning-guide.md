# Agency Positioning Guide

How to build and use agency positioning so you can win clients and reach $3,000–$10,000+/month.

## Overview

Clear positioning (who you serve, what you offer, why you're different) helps you stand out in proposals, on your website, and on LinkedIn. For Level 3, positioning supports premium pricing and partnership conversations. This guide covers messaging (positioning statement, proof points), where to show it (website, proposals, LinkedIn), and how to reinforce it (content, partnerships). Expected revenue for Level 3: $3,000–$10,000+/month; platform costs $100–300/month; time investment 8–12 weeks.

## Why Agency Positioning Matters

Without a clear position, you sound like every other "we do social media." With it, you attract the right clients and partners and can charge for expertise. Use this guide after completing the [Agency Operations Framework](agency-operations-framework.md) and [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) so your messaging matches your offer.

## Step 2: Where to Show It (Website, Proposals, LinkedIn)

**Time estimate:** 45–90 minutes (depending on how much you update)

#### 2.1 Website

- **Homepage:** Lead with your positioning statement and one differentiator. Add 2–3 proof points (testimonial, case study link, or metric).
- **Services:** Use your [Service Suite Development](service-suite-development.md) tiers; keep language consistent with your positioning.
- **About:** Short story that supports why you do this and who you serve (align with ideal client).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Homepage has positioning + proof; [ ] Services page matches service suite

#### 2.2 Proposals

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Every proposal includes positioning and at least one proof point

#### 2.3 LinkedIn

## Step 3: How to Reinforce (Content, Partnerships)

**Time estimate:** Ongoing

#### 3.1 Content

- Post consistently (LinkedIn, blog, or newsletter) on topics your ideal client cares about. Tie back to your positioning (e.g. "Why B2B brands need a content strategy").
- Use AI to draft thought leadership posts; always edit for your voice. See [Level 3 Plan – Working with AI](social-media-level-3-plan.md#working-with-ai-tools).

#### 3.2 Partnerships

- Use the [Partnership & Outreach Strategies](social-media-level-3-partnership-outreach-strategies.md) to align with agencies, brands, or complementary services. Your positioning makes it clear what you do so partners can refer the right fit.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Content routine in place; [ ] At least 2–3 partnership conversations in motion
