# Consultant Positioning Framework

Guided exercises to position as a premium freelance consultant so you're seen as a consultant, not a commodity—and can reach $4,000–$10,000+/month with direct clients and premium pricing.

## Purpose

This framework helps you define your expertise and niche, write a positioning statement that differentiates you from freelancers and agencies, plan thought leadership for visibility and authority, and align pricing and packaging at consultant level. Use it when you're ready to move beyond marketplace and full-time freelancing into premium consultant positioning.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes  
- **When:** Early in Level 3 (Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](freelancing-level-3-plan.md)); before heavy outreach or premium pricing.  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft a first pass of your positioning statement from your fill-ins; then edit for your voice and proof points.

Complete each part in order. Use the results in the [Premium Positioning Guide](freelancing-level-3-premium-positioning-guide.md) (where to show your positioning) and in the [Premium Pricing Models](freelancing-level-3-premium-pricing-models.md) (Part 4). See the [Direct Client Framework](direct-client-framework.md) for winning and retaining direct clients.

## Part 1: Expertise and Niche

### Define your consulting expertise and high-value problems

**Your consulting expertise (what you're known for):**
_________________________________________________

**Niche or industry (who you serve):**
_________________________________________________

**High-value problems you solve (outcomes clients pay premium for):**
_________________________________________________

**How you're different from a generic freelancer or agency (depth, method, results):**
_________________________________________________

**Example (B2B strategy):** "Expertise: go-to-market and positioning for B2B SaaS. Niche: seed to Series A. High-value problems: unclear positioning, slow launch. Different: 10+ launches, repeatable playbook, not just one-off projects."

**Example (content/design):** "Expertise: brand and content systems. Niche: D2C and professional services. High-value problems: inconsistent messaging, no content engine. Different: systems that scale, not single deliverables; retainers with clear KPIs."

## Part 2: Positioning Statement

### Write a clear positioning statement and differentiate from freelancers and agencies

**Formula:** *I help [ideal client] [achieve outcome] by [your method or differentiator], so they [result]. I'm not [freelancer/agency alternative]—I [what makes you consultant-level].*

**Your positioning statement:**
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

**How you're different from freelancers (e.g. strategic input, ongoing relationship, outcomes not tasks):**
_________________________________________________

**How you're different from agencies (e.g. senior-only, no handoffs, faster decisions):**
_________________________________________________

**One-line version (for LinkedIn, proposals, website):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "I help B2B SaaS founders nail positioning and launch in 8–12 weeks with a repeatable playbook, so they win early customers without hiring a full agency. I'm not a one-off freelancer—I own the strategy and execution. I'm not an agency—you get one senior consultant, no handoffs."

## Part 3: Thought Leadership

### Plan content and visibility to build authority

**3 topics you could write or speak about (aligned with Part 1):**
1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

**Where you'll show up (e.g. LinkedIn, blog, podcast guest, webinars):**
_________________________________________________

**Frequency you can sustain (e.g. 1 post/week, 1 article/month):**
_________________________________________________

**Proof points to weave in (case studies, results, testimonials):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Topics: positioning mistakes at launch, how to run a 90-day GTM, when to hire a consultant vs agency. Show up: LinkedIn 2×/week, one guest post per quarter. Proof: 3 client case studies with 'shipped in X weeks' and one video testimonial."

---

## Part 4: Pricing and Packaging

### Price and package at consultant level (project or retainer)

**Primary offer type (project / retainer / both):**
_________________________________________________

**Typical project range or retainer range (aligned with $4k–$10k+/month):**
_________________________________________________

**What's included that justifies consultant-level pricing (strategy, access, outcomes):**
_________________________________________________

**When you'll raise rates (e.g. after 3 strong case studies, when pipeline is full):**
_________________________________________________

Use the [Premium Pricing Models](freelancing-level-3-premium-pricing-models.md) for project vs retainer, value-based pricing, and when to raise. Use the Business Financial Planning (PDF) from the Planning section for revenue target, costs, and cash flow.
