# Client Acquisition Strategies (Level 2)

Strategies to acquire clients for full-time freelancing (Upwork, direct, referrals) so you can reach $1,500–$4,000/month.

## Overview

For full-time freelancing, you need multiple channels: platform work (e.g. Upwork) for volume and visibility, and direct clients and referrals for higher-ticket work and repeat business. This guide walks you through platform strategy, direct and referral acquisition, content and visibility, and consistency—with substeps and time estimates so you can act quickly.

## 1. Platform Strategy

**Time:** 1–2 hours setup; then ongoing (proposals daily or weekly)  
**Purpose:** Optimize your Upwork (or similar) profile and proposals so you win more jobs and maintain a strong JSS.

### Sub-steps

1. **Optimize your Upwork profile.** Run through the [Upwork Setup Guide](upwork-setup-guide.md): photo, headline, overview, work history, portfolio, hourly rate, availability, and categories. Ensure your profile matches the jobs you're bidding on (keywords, niche, outcomes).
2. **Send targeted proposals.** Use the [Proposal Templates](proposal-templates.zip) (ZIP) in this level for structure; personalize each proposal with the client's name, project details, and your relevant experience. **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft 2–3 proposal versions; then personalize. Aim for quality over volume (e.g. 5–10 strong proposals per week).
3. **Use proposals and JSS to win more jobs.** Maintain a high Job Success Score by delivering on time, communicating clearly, and resolving issues professionally. See the [Upwork Setup Guide](upwork-setup-guide.md) Step 4 (JSS) and the [Client Management Issues](freelancing-level-2-client-management-issues.md) for scope and communication.
4. **Balance platform work with direct clients.** Don't rely only on Upwork. Use direct outreach and referrals (Section 2) so you have a mix of platform and direct revenue. Track where your best clients come from and double down.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Profile optimized; [ ] Proposals sent regularly; [ ] JSS understood and maintained; [ ] Balance of platform and direct in mind

## 2. Direct and Referral

**Time:** 30–60 minutes per week (referral asks, outreach, pipeline)  
**Purpose:** Ask satisfied clients for referrals and use LinkedIn/email for value-led outreach so you build a direct pipeline.

### Sub-steps

1. **Ask satisfied clients for referrals and testimonials.** After delivery, use the [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md) feedback request. Add a line: "If you know anyone who might need [your service], I'd be grateful for an intro." Keep it low-pressure.
2. **Use LinkedIn and email for value-led outreach.** Don't cold-pitch. Share tips, case studies, or short insights (with client permission) so prospects see your expertise. Then reach out with a short, personalized message (e.g. "I saw you're [X]; I help [niche] with [outcome]. Would a 15-min call be useful?"). **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft 3 outreach templates; then personalize each.
3. **Build a simple pipeline (CRM or spreadsheet).** Track leads: name, source (referral, LinkedIn, etc.), status (contacted, call scheduled, proposal sent, won/lost). Use a spreadsheet or a simple CRM (e.g. HubSpot free, or a Notion table). Update weekly so you know what's working.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Referral ask in feedback request; [ ] LinkedIn/email outreach in use; [ ] Pipeline (spreadsheet or CRM) in place

## 3. Content and Visibility

**Time:** 1–2 hours per week (or per month if you start small)  
**Purpose:** Share tips and case studies so you position as an expert and attract inbound interest.

### Sub-steps

1. **Share tips and case studies (blog, LinkedIn).** Write short posts or articles: "How I [solved X for a client]" or "3 tips for [niche]." Use the [Professional Portfolio Framework](professional-portfolio-framework.md) case studies (with permission) as the basis. Keep it useful, not salesy.
2. **Position as an expert in your niche.** Use consistent messaging: who you help, what you deliver, what outcomes you get. See the [Portfolio Promotion Guide](freelancing-level-2-portfolio-promotion-guide.md) for where to show your portfolio and how to reinforce your positioning.
3. **Use the Portfolio Promotion Guide.** Apply the [Portfolio Promotion Guide](freelancing-level-2-portfolio-promotion-guide.md) for where to host your portfolio, what to highlight, how to share it (proposals, LinkedIn, email), and how to ask for testimonials.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Content (tips or case studies) shared; [ ] Positioning consistent; [ ] Portfolio promoted per guide

## 4. Consistency

**Time:** Ongoing  
**Purpose:** Follow up regularly and nurture leads so you don't lose opportunities.

### Sub-steps

1. **Follow up regularly.** If a prospect doesn't respond, send one polite follow-up (e.g. 5–7 days later). Don't spam. If they say no or not now, note it in your pipeline and move on.
2. **Nurture leads.** Add prospects to a simple nurture sequence (e.g. 2–3 value emails over 2–4 weeks) if they're not ready to buy. Share a tip or case study; then offer a call when they're ready.
3. **Track what works and double down.** In your pipeline, note source (Upwork, referral, LinkedIn, etc.) and outcome (won/lost). After 4–8 weeks, see which channel brings the best clients and invest more there.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Follow-up routine in place; [ ] Nurture (if used) in place; [ ] Pipeline reviewed weekly; [ ] Best channels identified
