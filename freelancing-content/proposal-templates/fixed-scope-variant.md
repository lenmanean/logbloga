# Proposal Variant: Fixed-Scope Project

Use this when the client has a defined project (e.g. one website, one course, 10 posts). Emphasize clear deliverables and a single total fee.

---

## 1. Intro

- Who you are; why you're a fit for this project.
- One sentence: "I'll deliver [X] by [date] so you can [outcome]."

## 2. Scope (fixed)

- **Deliverables:** Numbered list (e.g. 1. Strategy doc; 2. 10 blog posts; 3. 2 rounds of revisions each).
- **Out of scope:** Extra deliverables or rounds; new scope = change order.
- **Assumptions:** Content/access you need from the client; approval turnaround.

## 3. Timeline

- **Start:** Upon signed contract and deposit.
- **Milestones:** Draft 1 → feedback → final (with dates).
- **Delivery:** Final deliverable by [date].

## 4. Investment

- **Total project fee:** $X.
- **Payment:** e.g. 50% upfront, 50% on delivery. Or 3 milestones: 33% / 33% / 34%.
- **Included:** Deliverables above; 2 rounds of revisions; 1 kickoff call.

## 5. Next steps

- Confirm scope; sign contract (e.g. Hello Bonsai); pay deposit; start date.
