# Gig Listing Template

Ready-to-use template for Fiverr (or similar) gig listings. Copy each section and replace the sample text with your service and niche.

## Purpose

Use this template when creating or revising a gig so your title, description, pricing, and FAQ are clear and consistent. Fill it in after completing the [Service Definition Framework](service-definition-framework.md) and [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md) so your positioning and prices are set first.

## How to Use

1. Complete the [Service Definition Framework](service-definition-framework.md) and [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md) in this level.  
2. Copy the sections below into a doc or Fiverr gig editor.  
3. Replace every `[YOUR_TEXT]` (or bracketed slot) with your own text.  
4. Paste into Fiverr (or your platform) and stay within character limits (e.g. Fiverr gig title ~80 characters).  
5. Run through the [Profile Optimization Checklist](freelancing-level-1-profile-optimization-checklist.md) when you’re done.
