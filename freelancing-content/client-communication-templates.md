# Client Communication Templates

Ready-to-use templates for client communication (emails, updates, handoffs). Copy each section and replace the bracketed or sample text with your project and style.

## Purpose

Use these templates so every client gets consistent, professional communication: kickoff (scope and timeline), progress updates (what's done and what's next), delivery and handoff (deliverables and support), and feedback requests (testimonials and reviews). Consistent communication builds trust and reduces scope creep and surprises.

## How to Use

1. Copy the template you need (kickoff, progress, delivery, feedback).  
2. Replace every bracketed slot (e.g. `[Client name]`, `[Project name]`) with your project details and tone.  
3. Send from your professional email (e.g. Google Workspace).  
4. Use with the [Proposal Templates](proposal-templates.zip) and [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (ZIP) in this level so scope and terms are in writing.  
5. Reference the [Client Acquisition Strategies](freelancing-level-2-client-acquisition-strategies.md) for when to send (e.g. kickoff after contract signed, progress weekly, delivery on completion, feedback after delivery).

Best,  
[Your name]

## Feedback Request

**When to use:** After delivery (and, if applicable, after any revision round). Keeps it short so clients are more likely to respond.

### Subject line (customize)

**Subject:** Quick feedback on [project name]?

### Body (copy-paste and customize)

Hi [Client name],

Hope the [deliverables] are working well for you.

If you have 2 minutes, I’d really appreciate:
1. **Feedback** – What worked? Anything you’d change?  
2. **Testimonial** – A sentence or two I can use on my portfolio or Upwork (with your name and title, or anonymous).

You can reply to this email or leave a review on [Upwork / my site / etc.].

Thanks again for the project.

Best,  
[Your name]

## Customization Note

Customize tone (formal vs friendly) and length to match your service and client. Keep subject lines clear so clients can find the email later. Use with the [Proposal Templates](proposal-templates.zip) and [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (ZIP) in this level so scope and terms are aligned with your communication.
