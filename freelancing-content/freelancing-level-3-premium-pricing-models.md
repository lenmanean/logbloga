# Premium Pricing Models (Level 3)

Premium pricing models for freelance consultants so you price at consultant level and reach $4,000–$10,000+/month.

## Purpose

This guide helps you choose and apply pricing that fits consultant positioning: project vs retainer, value-based pricing, packaging for consultants, and when to raise. Use it with the [Consultant Positioning Framework](consultant-positioning-framework.md) Part 4 and the Business Financial Planning (PDF) from the Planning section so revenue and costs align with your positioning.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 30–45 minutes to plan; then review quarterly or when pipeline is full.  
- **When:** Use after completing the [Consultant Positioning Framework](consultant-positioning-framework.md) (positioning statement and Part 4 pricing). Use with the Business Financial Planning (PDF) for revenue target and costs.  
- **Cross-ref:** Use Contract Templates (Level 2) and Business Systems Templates (ZIP) in this level for terms and delivery.

Complete each part below. Use the results when you set new client rates and when you communicate changes to existing clients.

## Part 1: Project vs Retainer

### Choose the right structure for consultant-level revenue

**Project pricing:** Fixed fee for a defined scope and timeline (e.g. "90-day GTM project," "Brand and messaging package"). Best when the client has a clear outcome and you can scope it.

**Retainer pricing:** Recurring fee for ongoing work (e.g. monthly strategy, content, or advisory). Best when the client wants ongoing access and you want predictable revenue.

**Your primary offer (project / retainer / both):**
_________________________________________________

**Typical project range (e.g. $5k–$20k):**
_________________________________________________

**Typical retainer range (e.g. $3k–$8k/month):**
_________________________________________________

**Why this structure fits your positioning:** Use the [Consultant Positioning Framework](consultant-positioning-framework.md) Part 4. _________________________________________________

**Example:** "I offer both: 90-day GTM projects at $12k–$18k and monthly positioning retainers at $4k–$6k. Projects fit new launches; retainers fit ongoing strategy. Both align with consultant positioning—outcomes, not hours."

## Part 2: Value-Based Pricing

### Price based on client outcome and value, not hours

**Outcome you deliver (e.g. 'Shipped GTM in 12 weeks,' 'Positioning and messaging in place'):**
_________________________________________________

**Value to the client (e.g. faster launch, higher conversion, less internal cost):**
_________________________________________________

**How you set price:** Use discovery (see [Direct Client Framework](direct-client-framework.md) Part 3) to understand problem, timeline, and budget. Then scope and price to outcome: "This gets you [X] in [Y] weeks for [investment]."

**Your value-based range for this offer:**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Outcome: positioning and launch plan in 12 weeks. Value: client avoids 3 months of internal debate and launches with clear messaging. I price at $15k–$20k based on scope and client size—not hours."

## Part 3: Packaging for Consultants

### Structure offers so clients see consultant-level value

**Package name (e.g. '90-Day GTM,' 'Monthly Strategy Retainer'):**
_________________________________________________

**What's included (deliverables, access, timeline):**
_________________________________________________

**What's not included (out of scope, add-ons):**
_________________________________________________

**How you present it:** In proposals and on your website, lead with outcome and package—not "I charge $X/hour." Use the [Premium Positioning Guide](freelancing-level-3-premium-positioning-guide.md) for messaging.

**When to raise:** Use Part 4 below. _________________________________________________

**Example:** "90-Day GTM: kickoff, 4 strategy sessions, positioning doc, launch plan, 2 revision rounds. Not included: execution (dev/design), ongoing retainer. I present it as 'Get to launch in 12 weeks' and price at $15k."

## Part 4: When to Raise

### Raise rates for new (and where appropriate existing) clients

**When to raise for new clients:**  
[ ] Capacity is 80%+ full  
[ ] I've completed X projects in this niche: _________  
[ ] Pipeline is strong; I can afford to say no to low offers  
[ ] My outcomes and testimonials justify premium  

**How much to raise (e.g. 10–20%):**
_________________________________________________

**When to raise for existing clients:**  
[ ] At contract renewal or new project  
[ ] After 6–12 months of consistent work  
[ ] When I'm adding value (e.g. retainer, priority support)  

**How to communicate:** Give 30 days notice; state new rate and effective date; offer value in exchange (e.g. priority support, monthly check-in). Use Contract Templates (Level 2) or Business Systems Templates (ZIP) for amendments.

**Rate-change script (copy and customize):**  
"Hi [Client], I'm updating my rates effective [date]. For our work together, my new rate will be [X]. I'm also [adding value]. If you have questions, let's chat."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] When to raise defined; [ ] New rate set; [ ] Communication script ready; [ ] First new client or renewal at new rate
