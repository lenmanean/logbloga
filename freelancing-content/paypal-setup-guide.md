# PayPal Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for PayPal: payments and payouts for freelancers so you can receive Fiverr payouts and (optional) direct client payments within Level 1 ($500–$1,500/month, $0–20 platform costs).

## Overview

PayPal is widely used for freelancer payouts and client payments. Fiverr can pay you via PayPal (among other methods), and direct clients often prefer PayPal for simplicity. For Level 1, you need a verified account so payouts and withdrawals work without unnecessary holds. This guide covers creating an account, verification, requesting payments, and payouts—with typical timing and fees so you can plan for $500–$1,500/month revenue.

## Prerequisites

- Email address  
- Bank account (for verification and withdrawals)  
- Government-issued ID (for identity verification if prompted)  

**Time:** About 15–25 minutes (account ~5 min; verification ~10–15 min; request payments and payouts ~5 min).

## Step 1: Create a PayPal Account

**Time:** ~5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Sign up so you can receive and send money as a freelancer.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [paypal.com](https://www.paypal.com) and click **Sign Up**.
2. Choose **Business account** (recommended for freelancing—invoicing, PayPal.Me link, and clearer records) or **Personal** if you prefer to start simple.
3. Enter your **email** and create a **password**. Use an email you check regularly—PayPal sends payment and security notifications.
4. Complete the short form: name, address, phone (as required). Use your real details; PayPal may verify them.
5. **Verify your email** by clicking the link PayPal sends. Check spam if you don’t see it.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Account created; [ ] Email verified; [ ] Profile details completed

## Step 2: Verify Your Account

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes (some steps may take 1–3 days for bank/ID checks)  
**Purpose:** Raise limits and reduce holds so you can receive Fiverr payouts and direct payments without delay.

### Sub-step 2.1: Add and confirm your bank account

1. In PayPal, go to **Wallet** (or **Settings** > **Financial**).
2. Click **Link a bank account** and enter your bank details (routing and account number). Double-check numbers to avoid failed links.
3. PayPal will make **two small deposits** (or one deposit and one withdrawal) to confirm ownership. This can take 1–3 business days. Check your bank and enter the amounts in PayPal when prompted.
4. Once confirmed, your bank is linked for withdrawals (and sometimes for funding payments).

### Sub-step 2.2: Complete identity verification (if prompted)

1. If PayPal asks for **identity verification**, upload a government-issued ID (driver’s license or passport) as instructed.
2. Complete any **phone verification** (SMS or call) if requested.
3. New or low-volume accounts may have **holds** on incoming funds for 21 days (or until delivery is confirmed, e.g. Fiverr order marked complete). Verification and a good history can reduce or shorten holds over time.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Bank account linked and confirmed; [ ] Identity verification completed (if prompted); [ ] No errors on Wallet page

## Step 3: Request Payments

**Time:** ~2–5 minutes per request  
**Purpose:** Get paid by direct clients via PayPal when you’re not using Fiverr or another platform.

### Sub-steps

1. **Share your PayPal.Me link or email:** In PayPal, find your **PayPal.Me** link (e.g. paypal.me/YourName) or use your **email** associated with the account. Send this to clients so they can pay you directly.
2. **When to use:** Use for **direct clients** (work outside Fiverr) or when a client prefers PayPal. For **Fiverr orders**, Fiverr handles payment; you withdraw from Fiverr to PayPal (or bank) after the order is complete.
3. **Invoicing:** If you use Hello Bonsai (or another tool) for invoices, add your PayPal link or email to the invoice so the client knows where to pay. See the [Hello Bonsai Setup Guide](hello-bonsai-setup-guide.md).
4. **Fees:** PayPal charges a fee for receiving payments (e.g. a percentage of the amount). Check PayPal’s current fee page for your country and account type. Factor this into your pricing—see the [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] PayPal.Me or email known; [ ] Shared with client or added to invoice when relevant

## Step 4: Payouts

**Time:** ~2–5 minutes per withdrawal; funds may take 1–3 business days  
**Purpose:** Move money from PayPal to your bank so you can use it.

### Sub-steps

1. In PayPal, go to **Wallet** and select your **balance** (or **Withdraw**).
2. Choose **Transfer to bank** and select the bank account you linked.
3. Enter the amount and confirm. Typical **timing:** 1–3 business days to your bank. Instant transfer may be available for a fee.
4. **Fees:** Standard transfers to a bank are often free; instant transfer may have a fee. Check PayPal’s current pricing.
5. **Fiverr:** When Fiverr pays you to PayPal, the funds appear in your PayPal balance. Then use this same “Transfer to bank” flow to move them to your account.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Bank account selected; [ ] Transfer initiated; [ ] Funds arrived (within 1–3 business days)
