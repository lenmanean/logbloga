# Portfolio Showcase Template

Ready-to-use structure for your freelancing portfolio. Copy each section and replace placeholders with your name, services, and projects. Use this for your Fiverr profile portfolio, a simple one-page site, or proposals.

## Purpose

This template gives you a one-page portfolio structure so buyers can see who you are, what you offer, and proof of your work. Use it to fill your Fiverr profile portfolio, link from gigs, or build a simple standalone page. Fill it in using the [Portfolio Creation Framework](portfolio-creation-framework.md) in this level.

## How to Use

1. Complete the [Portfolio Creation Framework](portfolio-creation-framework.md) so you have 3–5 projects and outcomes.  
2. Copy the sections below and replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` with your content.  
3. Keep tone and style consistent with your gigs so you look cohesive.  
4. Use this structure on Fiverr (profile + gig images) or on a simple page (e.g. Linktree, Notion, or a one-page site).

## Customization Note

Keep your tone and style consistent with your gigs. If your gigs are friendly and casual, your portfolio should match. If they’re formal and corporate, keep the portfolio aligned. Use the [Portfolio Creation Framework](portfolio-creation-framework.md) to choose and describe projects, and the [Fiverr Profile Setup Guide](fiverr-profile-setup-guide.md) for how to add portfolio items to Fiverr.
