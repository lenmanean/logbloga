# Portfolio Promotion Guide (Level 2)

How to promote your freelancing portfolio to attract full-time clients and reach $1,500–$4,000/month.

## Purpose

A strong portfolio wins jobs only if clients see it. This guide tells you where to host your portfolio, what to highlight, how to share it (proposals, LinkedIn, email), and how to ask for testimonials—so you get more visibility and more clients.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 30–60 minutes to set up channels; then ongoing (share when you send proposals, post content, or ask for feedback).  
- **When:** After completing the [Professional Portfolio Framework](professional-portfolio-framework.md) so you have case studies and positioning.  
- **Cross-ref:** Use with the [Client Acquisition Strategies](freelancing-level-2-client-acquisition-strategies.md) for platform and direct outreach.

## 1. Portfolio Quality

**Time:** 45–60 minutes (if not yet done)  
**Purpose:** Ensure your portfolio is ready to promote: case studies, testimonials, and easy navigation.

### Sub-steps

1. **Use the Professional Portfolio Framework.** Complete the [Professional Portfolio Framework](professional-portfolio-framework.md) in this level: positioning, 2–3 case studies (problem, solution, result), presentation (layout, branding, mobile), and update plan.
2. **Include case studies and testimonials.** Each case study should have a clear outcome (metric or result) and, if possible, a client quote. Use the framework's fill-in prompts and **AI tip** (ChatGPT to turn bullets into 2–3 sentence case studies).
3. **Keep it up to date and easy to navigate.** Add new work every 2–3 months; remove outdated or weak samples. Use clear headings and one project or case study per section so clients can scan quickly.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Framework completed; [ ] Case studies and testimonials in place; [ ] Navigation clear; [ ] Updated recently

## 2. Channels

**Time:** 20–30 minutes to set up; then ongoing  
**Purpose:** Decide where to host and share your portfolio so clients can find you.

### Sub-steps

1. **LinkedIn: profile, posts, and outreach.** Add your portfolio link to your LinkedIn profile (Featured or Contact section). Post short tips or case studies (with permission) so prospects see your work. Use LinkedIn for value-led outreach (see [Client Acquisition Strategies](freelancing-level-2-client-acquisition-strategies.md) Section 2).
2. **Website or Notion: portfolio and contact.** Host your portfolio on a simple website (e.g. Carrd, Notion, or your own domain) or a Notion page. Include: who you are, 2–4 case studies, and a clear contact (email or Calendly). Use the [Professional Portfolio Framework](professional-portfolio-framework.md) structure.
3. **Upwork (or similar): profile and proposals.** Add your portfolio link to your Upwork profile and attach or link to samples in proposals. Use the [Upwork Setup Guide](upwork-setup-guide.md) for profile optimization.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] LinkedIn profile and link set; [ ] Website or Notion (or equivalent) live; [ ] Upwork profile and proposals include portfolio link

## 3. Content

**Time:** 1–2 hours per week (or per month)  
**Purpose:** Share project summaries and tips so you position as an expert and attract inbound interest.

### Sub-steps

1. **Share project summaries and tips (with client permission).** Write short posts: "How I [deliverable] for [client type]" or "3 tips for [niche]." Use your case studies as the basis; anonymize or get permission before naming clients.
2. **Write short case studies (problem, solution, result).** Use the same structure as your portfolio: problem, solution, result (and testimonial if any). Post on LinkedIn, your blog, or Notion so prospects can see proof.
3. **Use Client Communication Templates.** When you deliver work, use the [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md) feedback request to ask for testimonials and permission to use the project in your portfolio (anonymized or named).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Content (summaries or tips) shared; [ ] Case studies in use; [ ] Feedback request and permission ask in place

## 4. Promotion

**Time:** Ongoing  
**Purpose:** Link your portfolio in proposals and emails, ask clients to share or refer, and reinforce with the Client Acquisition Strategies.

### Sub-steps

1. **Link portfolio in proposals and emails.** Every Upwork (or similar) proposal and every outreach email should include your portfolio link. One line is enough: "Here's my portfolio: [link]."
2. **Ask clients to share your work or refer you.** After delivery, use the [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md) feedback request. Add: "If you're happy with the work, a referral or a share on LinkedIn would mean a lot."
3. **Use the Client Acquisition Strategies guide.** Apply the [Client Acquisition Strategies](freelancing-level-2-client-acquisition-strategies.md) for platform strategy, direct and referral, content and visibility, and consistency—so promotion is part of a system, not one-off.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Portfolio link in proposals and emails; [ ] Referral and share ask in feedback request; [ ] Acquisition strategies applied
