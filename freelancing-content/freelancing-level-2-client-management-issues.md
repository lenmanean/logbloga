# Client Management Issues (Level 2)

Common client and project management issues for full-time freelancers. For each issue: causes, step-by-step resolution, prevention, and when to escalate.

---

## 1. Scope and Contracts

**Issue:** Scope creep or payment disputes—client asks for more than agreed, or payment is delayed or disputed.

### Causes

- Scope and revisions not defined in writing (no contract or vague proposal).  
- Contract or proposal doesn't list deliverables, revision count, or payment schedule clearly.  
- Client assumes more is included; you assume it's out of scope.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Refer to the contract or proposal.** If you have a contract (e.g. [Hello Bonsai Paid Setup](hello-bonsai-paid-setup.md)) or a written proposal, point to the scope and revision clauses. "Per our contract, this package includes [X]. Additional [Y] would be an add-on at [price]."
2. **Define scope and revisions in writing.** Use the [Proposal Templates](proposal-templates.zip) and [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (ZIP) in this level so every new project has deliverables, revision count, and payment in writing. For existing projects without a contract, send a short email confirming scope and revisions and ask the client to confirm.
3. **Offer a clear revision or add-on path.** If the client wants more, offer a paid add-on or a new scope document (amendment). Don't do unlimited revisions or extra work for free—it sets a bad precedent.
4. **Use Hello Bonsai (or similar) for contracts.** For direct or custom work, send a contract via [Hello Bonsai Paid Setup](hello-bonsai-paid-setup.md) so scope, payment, and timeline are in writing. If a dispute arises, you have proof.

### Prevention

- Use the [Proposal Templates](proposal-templates.zip) and [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (ZIP) for every new project.  
- Confirm scope in the kickoff email using the [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md).  
- Set revision count (e.g. 2 rounds) and state what's out of scope (e.g. "Additional pages beyond 5 are add-ons").

### When to escalate

- **Payment dispute:** Respond with proof (contract, deliverables, messages) via the platform (Upwork) or payment provider (Stripe, PayPal). Escalate to platform support or mediation if the client refuses to pay for delivered work.  
- **Legal threat or breach:** If the client threatens legal action or breaches the contract, consult a lawyer or use platform dispute resolution (Upwork, etc.).

## 2. Communication

**Issue:** Missed messages or unclear updates—client doesn't respond, or expectations on response time and updates don't match.

### Causes

- No set expectation for response time (you or the client).  
- Updates sent in different channels (email, Upwork, Slack) so messages get lost.  
- No regular progress updates so the client is left guessing.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Set response-time expectations.** In the kickoff email (use the [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md)), state how quickly you'll respond (e.g. "I typically respond within 24 hours on weekdays") and ask the client what they prefer. Stick to one primary channel per client (e.g. Upwork messages or email).
2. **Use Client Communication Templates.** Use the [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md) for kickoff, progress update, delivery, and feedback request. Send progress updates on a schedule (e.g. weekly or at milestones) so the client is never surprised.
3. **Use one channel per client where possible.** If the client prefers email, use email for all project communication. If they use Upwork messages, keep it there. Avoid scattering updates across email, Slack, and Upwork unless the client explicitly uses multiple channels.
4. **Catch up if you've missed messages.** If you missed a message, apologize briefly, answer the question, and confirm the primary channel going forward. Don't over-explain; just fix the process.

### Prevention

- Include response-time and channel in the kickoff email (Client Communication Templates).  
- Block time in your calendar for client communication (e.g. 30 min morning and afternoon) so you don't miss messages.  
- Send progress updates on a set schedule (e.g. every Friday or at each milestone).

### When to escalate

- **Client unreachable:** If the client goes silent for 2+ weeks and you've sent 2–3 follow-ups, document it (messages, dates) and consider the project paused. Use platform rules (Upwork) for inactive contracts.  
- **Harassment or abuse:** If the client is abusive or threatening, report to the platform (Upwork, etc.) and do not continue until the platform responds.

## 3. Multiple Clients

**Issue:** Overload or missed deadlines—too many clients or tasks at once, or deadlines slipping.

### Causes

- No calendar or task list so you double-book or forget deadlines.  
- Saying yes to every new project without checking capacity.  
- No focus blocks so you context-switch too much and deliver late.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Use a calendar and task list.** Block time for each client and each deliverable. Use Google Calendar (see [Google Workspace Setup](google-workspace-setup.md)) or your preferred tool. Add deadlines and set reminders 2–3 days before so you don't miss.
2. **Block focus time.** Block 2–4 hour focus blocks for deep work (no meetings, no email). Use focus time for delivery; use other blocks for communication and admin.
3. **Use the Full-Time Budget Planner.** Use the [Full-Time Budget Planner](freelancing-level-2-full-time-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section to track revenue and capacity. If you're at 80%+ capacity, stop taking new work until you deliver or raise rates (see [Pricing Scaling Strategy](freelancing-level-2-pricing-scaling-strategy.md)).
4. **Communicate early if you'll miss a deadline.** If you see a deadline slipping, message the client immediately: "I'm going to need 2 more days for [deliverable]. I'll deliver by [new date]. Apologies for the delay." Don't wait until the last day.

### Prevention

- Before saying yes to a new project, check your calendar and task list. If you're full, say no or propose a later start date.  
- Add "availability" to your Upwork profile or proposals (e.g. "Available for projects starting [date]").  
- Review capacity weekly; use the [Full-Time Budget Planner](freelancing-level-2-full-time-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) to see if you're overcommitted.

### When to escalate

- **Client demands impossible deadline:** If the client insists on a deadline you can't meet, offer a realistic date or decline. Don't overcommit and then miss.  
- **Burnout:** If you're consistently overloaded, reduce new clients, raise rates (Pricing Scaling Strategy), or extend delivery times. Use the Planning section for budget and capacity.

## 4. Difficult Clients

**Issue:** Unreasonable requests or conflict—client asks for out-of-scope work, refuses to pay, or becomes hostile.

### Causes

- Scope or contract unclear so the client thinks more is included.  
- No clear revision path so the client keeps asking for "one more change."  
- Mismatch in expectations (quality, timeline, or communication style).

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Refer back to the contract.** Point to the contract or proposal: scope, revisions, payment. "Per our agreement, we have [X] revision rounds. We've used [Y]. Additional revisions are [add-on price]." Stay calm and factual.
2. **Offer a clear revision path.** If the client wants more revisions, offer a paid add-on (e.g. "2 more revision rounds for $X") or a new scope document. Don't do unlimited free revisions—it encourages scope creep.
3. **Know when to decline or end the relationship.** If the client refuses to pay, breaches the contract, or is abusive, decline further work and end the contract. Use platform dispute resolution (Upwork) or small claims if needed. Document everything (messages, contract, deliverables).
4. **Use a polite script for out-of-scope requests.** "I'd love to help with that. It's outside our current scope, so I'd need to add it as an extra. Here's what it would cost and how long it would take: [X]. Let me know if you want to proceed."

### Prevention

- Use the [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (ZIP) and [Hello Bonsai Paid Setup](hello-bonsai-paid-setup.md) so scope and revisions are in writing.  
- Set revision count and state what's out of scope in the proposal and kickoff email.  
- Screen clients: if red flags (vague scope, low budget, aggressive tone), consider declining or clarifying before you start.

### When to escalate

- **Payment refusal:** Use platform dispute (Upwork) or payment provider (Stripe, PayPal) dispute process. Provide contract, deliverables, and messages. Escalate to platform support or mediation if needed.  
- **Abuse or threats:** Report to the platform and do not continue. Block communication if necessary.  
- **Legal action:** If the client threatens to sue or you need to recover payment, consult a lawyer or use small claims court (depending on amount and jurisdiction).
