# Client Management Issues (Level 2)

Common client and project management issues for full-time freelancers.

## 1. Scope and Contracts

- **Issue:** Scope creep or payment disputes  
- **Solutions:** Use Proposal and Contract Templates (ZIP) in this level; define scope and revisions in writing; use Hello Bonsai or similar

## 2. Communication

- **Issue:** Missed messages or unclear updates  
- **Solutions:** Use Client Communication Templates in this level; set response-time expectations; use one channel per client where possible

## 3. Multiple Clients

- **Issue:** Overload or missed deadlines  
- **Solutions:** Use a calendar and task list; block focus time; use the Full-Time Budget Planner (Planning) in this level

## 4. Difficult Clients

- **Solutions:** Refer back to contract; offer a clear revision path; know when to decline or end the relationship

See the Planning section in this level for budget and pricing scaling.
