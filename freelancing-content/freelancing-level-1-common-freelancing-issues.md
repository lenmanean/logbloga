# Common Freelancing Issues (Level 1)

Common issues and solutions for part-time freelancers (Fiverr, payments, clients). For each issue: causes, step-by-step resolution, prevention, and when to escalate.

---

## 1. Profile and Gigs (Low Visibility or Few Orders)

**Issue:** Your gig(s) get little or no traffic, or you get few or no orders.

### Causes

- Wrong or broad category so buyers don’t find you when they search or filter.  
- Weak or missing keywords in title, description, or tags so the platform doesn’t show you for relevant searches.  
- No or poor gig images so buyers scroll past.  
- Price or delivery time out of line for a new seller (e.g. too high for no reviews, or too low and looks suspicious).

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Audit title, description, and tags.**  
   Does your primary keyword appear in the gig title and in the first line of the description? Are your search tags aligned with what buyers search for? Use the [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md) and [Profile Optimization Checklist](freelancing-level-1-profile-optimization-checklist.md) to fix gaps.

2. **Align with Buyer Request language.**  
   If your platform has Buyer Requests (or similar), read how buyers describe their needs. Use similar words in your title and description so you match their search.

3. **Add or improve gig images.**  
   Minimum 1 image; recommend 3. Use clear, relevant images (sample work, process, or professional graphic). See the [Portfolio Creation Framework](portfolio-creation-framework.md) and [Fiverr Profile Setup Guide](fiverr-profile-setup-guide.md).

4. **Adjust pricing or delivery time.**  
   If you have no or few reviews, consider a slightly lower entry price or a shorter delivery time (if you can deliver) to win first orders. Don’t undercut yourself long-term—use the [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md) to set a floor. If your price is very high for a new seller, test a lower Basic package.

### Prevention

- Run the [Profile Optimization Checklist](freelancing-level-1-profile-optimization-checklist.md) at least once, then monthly.  
- A/B test one element at a time (e.g. title, first line of description, or one image) and give it 1–2 weeks before changing again.

### When to escalate

- If you’ve optimized and still get zero impressions or orders after 2–4 weeks: check platform status, account restrictions, or category saturation. Contact platform support (e.g. Fiverr Help Center) if your account or gig is restricted or not showing.

## 2. Payments and Payouts (Delays or Holds)

**Issue:** Payments are delayed or held (PayPal, Fiverr, or other).

### Causes

- Verification pending (identity, bank, or phone) so the platform holds funds.  
- New account or low history so the platform holds payouts until delivery is confirmed or for a set period (e.g. 21 days).  
- Policy breach (e.g. chargeback, dispute, or terms violation) so the platform freezes or holds funds.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Complete verification.**  
   In PayPal: link and confirm bank account; complete identity verification if prompted. In Fiverr: complete any seller verification (ID, phone). See the [PayPal Setup Guide](paypal-setup-guide.md).

2. **Check status in PayPal or Fiverr.**  
   In PayPal: Wallet → Activity to see pending or held funds and any messages. In Fiverr: Earnings or Payouts to see when funds are available (e.g. 7–14 days after order completion for new sellers).

3. **Follow platform policy.**  
   Don’t request payment off-platform before delivery if it violates terms. Mark orders complete only when work is delivered. Respond to any dispute or chargeback with evidence (messages, deliverables) per platform instructions.

4. **Note typical hold duration.**  
   New Fiverr sellers often have a clearance period (e.g. 7–14 days after order completion). PayPal may hold for 21 days for new accounts. Plan your budget so you’re not depending on instant withdrawal at first.

### Prevention

- Set client expectations on payment timing (e.g. "Payouts are available X days after order completion").  
- For direct clients, use [Hello Bonsai](hello-bonsai-setup-guide.md) for contracts and invoices so payment terms are clear.

### When to escalate

- **Payment dispute or chargeback:** Respond with proof (delivery, messages) via the platform’s dispute process. Escalate to platform support if the buyer is fraudulent or the dispute is invalid.  
- **Account restriction or permanent hold:** Contact platform support (PayPal Resolution Center, Fiverr Support) with your account details and ask what’s required to lift the hold.

## 3. Client Communication (Scope Creep or Unclear Expectations)

**Issue:** Buyers ask for more than agreed, or expectations don’t match what you delivered.

### Causes

- Vague gig description or FAQ so buyers assume more than you intended.  
- No contract for custom or direct work so scope and revisions aren’t in writing.  
- Saying "yes" to every request so scope grows without extra pay or time.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Confirm scope in the first message.**  
   When a buyer orders or inquires, repeat what’s included: deliverables, revision count, delivery date. E.g. "Just to confirm: this package includes [X]. I’ll deliver by [date]. Additional revisions can be added as an extra."

2. **Send a contract for custom work.**  
   For custom scope or direct clients, use a contract (e.g. [Hello Bonsai Setup Guide](hello-bonsai-setup-guide.md)) with scope, deliverables, revision count, and payment. Send before starting work.

3. **Say "no" to out-of-scope work with a polite script.**  
   E.g. "That would be outside this package. I can add it as an extra for $X and Y extra days, or we can keep the current scope." Offer a paid add-on instead of doing free work.

### Prevention

- Use a clear gig description and FAQ (see [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md)). State what’s included and what’s not (e.g. "2 revision rounds included; more available as add-on").  
- Use a contract for every direct or custom order so scope and revisions are documented.

### When to escalate

- **Abusive or threatening buyer:** Report to the platform (Fiverr, etc.) and do not continue until the platform responds.  
- **Dispute over scope or delivery:** Use order messages and contract as evidence. Escalate to platform support if the buyer opens a dispute and you have proof of delivery and scope.

## 4. Time and Burnout (Overcommitting or Undercharging)

**Issue:** Too many orders, too little time, or you’re earning too little for the work.

### Causes

- Accepting too many orders at once without blocking time for delivery.  
- Undercharging so you need many orders to hit $500–$1,500/month and burn out.  
- No boundaries (revision rounds, response time, or availability) so work spills into all hours.

### Step-by-step resolution

1. **Use the Side Hustle Budget Planner and Pricing Calculator Worksheet.**  
   Download the [Side Hustle Budget Planner](freelancing-level-1-side-hustle-budget-planner.pdf) and [Pricing Calculator Worksheet](freelancing-level-1-pricing-calculator-worksheet.pdf) from the Planning section. Track revenue and costs; recalculate your minimum price and package prices so you’re not undercharging.

2. **Set a max orders per week (or per delivery window).**  
   Don’t accept more than you can deliver on time. If you’re full, extend delivery time on your gig or pause new orders until you catch up.

3. **Increase price or delivery time.**  
   If you’re overwhelmed or underpaid: raise your Basic/Standard/Premium prices or add 1–2 days to delivery so you have buffer. Use the [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md) so you stay above your minimum.

### Prevention

- Block time for delivery in your calendar so you don’t overcommit.  
- Add "availability" or "current delivery time" to your FAQ so buyers know what to expect.  
- Set revision count in your gig and stick to it; offer paid add-ons for more revisions.

### When to escalate

- If stress or workload is affecting your health: reduce orders, raise prices, or pause new gigs until you’re sustainable. Use the Planning worksheets to plan a realistic path to $500–$1,500/month.
