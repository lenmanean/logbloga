# First Client Acquisition Guide (Level 1)

How to acquire your first freelancing clients on Fiverr and beyond so you can reach $500–$1,500/month as a part-time freelancer.

## Overview

Your first clients matter for three reasons: **reviews** (buyers trust sellers with ratings), **ranking** (platforms favor active, on-time sellers), and **repeat work and referrals** (one happy client can lead to more). This guide walks you through optimizing your profile and gigs, improving visibility and search, and converting first orders—with substeps and time estimates so you can act quickly.

## 1. Optimize Your Profile and Gigs

**Time:** 1–2 hours (one-time; then small tweaks)  
**Purpose:** Make your profile and gigs complete and compelling so buyers trust you and click "Order."

### Sub-steps

1. **Run the Profile Optimization Checklist.**  
   Go through the [Profile Optimization Checklist](freelancing-level-1-profile-optimization-checklist.md) in this level. Tick every item: professional photo, clear bio and tagline, skills and language, verification. Then do the same for each gig (title, description, keywords, category, pricing, images, FAQ).

2. **Ensure title, description, FAQ, and keywords are aligned.**  
   Your primary keyword should appear in the gig title and in the first line of the description. FAQ answers should match what you promise in the description (delivery time, revisions, scope). Tags should support (not duplicate) the same theme. See the [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md) and [Fiverr Profile Setup Guide](fiverr-profile-setup-guide.md) for structure.

3. **Add at least 3 images per gig.**  
   Use clear, relevant images (sample work, process, or professional graphic). Minimum 1; recommend 3 so buyers can scroll and trust. See the Fiverr guide for image requirements and the [Portfolio Creation Framework](portfolio-creation-framework.md) for what to show.

4. **Set realistic delivery time and revision count.**  
   Choose a delivery time you can reliably meet (e.g. 3 or 5 days). Set revision count (e.g. 1–2 for Level 1) so buyers know what’s included and you avoid scope creep. Document both in the gig and FAQ.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Profile Optimization Checklist completed; [ ] Title/description/FAQ/keywords aligned; [ ] 3+ images per gig; [ ] Delivery and revisions set and stated

## 2. Visibility and Search

**Time:** 15–30 minutes to set up; then ongoing (e.g. daily Buyer Requests)  
**Purpose:** Get your gig in front of buyers via search and Buyer Requests so you get inquiries and orders.

### Sub-steps

1. **Choose 2–3 primary keywords** and use them in your gig title, first line of description, and search tags. Don’t stuff; use natural variations (e.g. "logo design," "brand identity," "custom logo"). Check what top sellers in your category use—then differentiate with your niche (e.g. "logo for small business").

2. **Check category and filters.**  
   Your gig should sit in the right category and subcategory so buyers find you when they browse. If Fiverr (or your platform) has filters (e.g. delivery time, price), make sure your gig fits how buyers filter (e.g. "3-day delivery").

3. **Use Buyer Requests (or equivalent) daily.**  
   If your platform has a Buyer Requests (or "Requests" / "Jobs") section, check it daily. Send **personalized** offers: reference the buyer’s project, say what you’ll deliver and in how long, and keep it short. Don’t copy-paste the same message to everyone—buyers can tell. **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to write 3 different Buyer Request response templates; then personalize each one for the specific request.

4. **Avoid spam.**  
   Don’t send generic or duplicate messages. Don’t message buyers outside the platform before an order (unless the platform allows it). Follow platform rules so you don’t get warnings or restrictions.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] 2–3 keywords in title, first line, tags; [ ] Category and filters correct; [ ] Buyer Requests checked and personalized offers sent (if available); [ ] No spam behavior

## 3. First Orders

**Time:** Per order (ongoing)  
**Purpose:** Convert inquiries into orders, deliver on time, and get reviews so you build reputation and move toward $500–$1,500/month.

### Sub-steps

1. **Respond to inquiries within 2–4 hours** when possible. Fast response improves conversion and shows you’re serious. Set notifications so you don’t miss messages.

2. **Confirm scope and delivery in the first message or contract.**  
   Repeat what’s included (deliverables, revision count, delivery date). For custom work or direct clients, use a contract (e.g. [Hello Bonsai Setup Guide](hello-bonsai-setup-guide.md)) so there’s no confusion. This reduces scope creep and disputes.

3. **Deliver on or before the deadline.**  
   If you’re going to be late, message the buyer early and propose a new date. On-time delivery protects your rating and helps the algorithm.

4. **Add a small extra** (e.g. thank-you note, clear delivery message, or one extra tweak within scope). It builds goodwill and increases the chance of a good review.

5. **Request a review after delivery.**  
   Once the order is complete, send a short, polite message asking for feedback (per platform rules). Don’t offer incentives for positive reviews—platforms may penalize that.

6. **Document what worked.**  
   Note which gig, keyword, or Buyer Request led to the order. Use that to double down (e.g. refresh that gig, send more similar offers).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Responses within 2–4 hours; [ ] Scope and delivery confirmed; [ ] Delivered on time; [ ] Review requested; [ ] What worked noted for next time
