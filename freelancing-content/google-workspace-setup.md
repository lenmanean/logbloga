# Google Workspace Setup (Freelancers)

Step-by-step instructions for Google Workspace: email, calendar, and Drive so you have a professional presence for full-time freelancing ($1,500–$4,000/month).

## Overview

Google Workspace gives you professional email (@yourdomain), Calendar, and Drive. For Level 2 full-time freelancing, a dedicated email and calendar improve credibility and make it easier to schedule client calls and organize deliverables. This guide walks you through choosing a plan, setting up email and calendar, using Drive for projects, and best practices so you stay organized.

## Prerequisites

- A **domain name** (e.g. yourname.com or yourbusiness.com) for custom email, or use a free Gmail with a professional display name  
- Google account (or willingness to create one)  
- Optional: Existing Google account to upgrade to Workspace  

**Time:** About 20–40 minutes (plan and email ~15 min; calendar and Drive ~10 min; best practices ~5 min).

## Step 1: Choose a Plan

**Time:** ~5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Select a Google Workspace plan that fits your budget and needs.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [workspace.google.com](https://workspace.google.com) and click **Get started**.
2. Choose **Business Starter** (or equivalent) if you need custom email (@yourdomain) and basic Drive storage. Higher tiers add more storage and features (e.g. Meet recording).
3. Enter your **domain name** (e.g. yourname.com). If you don't have one, you can use a free Gmail account and set a professional display name (e.g. "Jane Doe | Freelance Designer") for Level 2; upgrade to Workspace later when you have a domain.
4. Complete sign-up and payment (if paid plan). Verify domain ownership (e.g. add a TXT record at your domain registrar) if prompted.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Plan chosen; [ ] Domain entered and verified (or Gmail with professional name set)

## Step 2: Email and Calendar

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set up professional email and calendar for client communication and meetings.

### Sub-step 2.1: Professional email

1. **Custom email:** If you have Workspace, your email is now name@yourdomain.com. Use it for all client communication so you look consistent and professional.
2. **Display name:** In Gmail or Workspace settings, set your **display name** (e.g. "Jane Doe" or "Jane Doe | Freelance Developer") so clients see it in their inbox.
3. **Signature:** Add a short email signature (name, title or tagline, link to portfolio or Upwork). Keep it minimal.

### Sub-step 2.2: Calendar for client meetings and deadlines

1. Open **Google Calendar** (calendar.google.com or via Workspace).
2. Create **calendars** (optional): e.g. "Client calls," "Deliverables," "Admin." Color-code so you can see at a glance.
3. **Block time** for deep work and deliverables so you don't overbook. Share availability with clients via Calendar's "Find a time" or a link (e.g. Calendly if you add it later).
4. **Invite clients** to meetings by sending calendar invites so both of you get reminders and avoid no-shows.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Professional email in use; [ ] Display name and signature set; [ ] Calendar in use for calls and deadlines; [ ] Availability blocked for focus time

## Step 3: Google Drive

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Organize project files and client deliverables so you can share and collaborate.

### Sub-steps

1. **Folder structure:** Create a top-level folder per client (e.g. "Client – Acme Corp") and inside it subfolders per project or deliverable (e.g. "Project 1 – Redesign," "Final files").
2. **Sharing:** Share folders or files with clients via **Share** > add their email > set permission (Viewer or Commenter). Use "Copy link" for view-only links if you prefer not to require a Google account.
3. **Deliverables:** Upload final deliverables to the client folder and share the folder or specific files. Add a short note in email (e.g. "Final files are in the shared folder; link below") using your [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md).
4. **Backup:** Drive is cloud-backed; for critical files, consider an extra backup (e.g. download key folders periodically).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Folder structure created; [ ] Sharing and permissions understood; [ ] Deliverables shared via Drive; [ ] Backup habit (if desired)

## Step 4: Best Practices

**Time:** ~5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Use labels, filters, and shared drives to keep full-time freelancing organized.

### Sub-steps

1. **Gmail labels:** Create labels for "Clients," "Upwork," "Invoices," etc. Filter incoming mail into labels so you can prioritize (e.g. client emails first).
2. **Filters:** Set up filters (e.g. emails from @upwork.com → label "Upwork") to auto-organize.
3. **Shared drives (if on paid plan):** Use a shared drive for a team or for client-facing assets if you collaborate with others; otherwise, My Drive per client is enough.
4. **Notifications:** Turn on notifications for calendar events and important emails; mute or batch the rest so you're not distracted.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Labels and filters in use; [ ] Notifications tuned; [ ] Routine for checking email and calendar set
