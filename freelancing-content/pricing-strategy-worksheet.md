# Pricing Strategy Worksheet

Guided exercises to set pricing for your freelancing services so you reach $500–$1,500/month without undercharging or scaring buyers away.

## Purpose

Right pricing attracts the right clients and keeps you profitable. Too low and you burn out; too high for a new seller and you get no orders. This worksheet helps you land on a minimum price, position against the market, and define clear packages (Basic/Standard/Premium) that align with your time and goals.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 20–30 minutes  
- **When:** Complete before setting gig prices (Phase 2, Step 2.2 of the Implementation Plan).  
- **Use with:** The [Pricing Calculator Worksheet](freelancing-level-1-pricing-calculator-worksheet.pdf) (PDF) in the Planning section for the math—minimum price, market check, and package builder. This worksheet is the strategy; the PDF is the calculator.

Complete each part below. Use the results in the [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md) when you set your packages.

## Part 1: Cost and Time

### Know your floor so you don't undercharge

**Time per deliverable (hours):**
_________________________________________________

**Platform fee (e.g. Fiverr 20%):**
_________________________________________________

**Tax/overhead (e.g. 15–25%):**
_________________________________________________

**Minimum price per order (after fees and overhead):**
_________________________________________________

Use the Pricing Calculator Worksheet (PDF) to compute this if needed. Never set your lowest package below this minimum.

## Part 2: Market and Competitors

### Where you sit in your niche

**3 competitors' rates (e.g. Basic/Standard/Premium or single price):**
1. _________________________________________________  
2. _________________________________________________  
3. _________________________________________________

**Market range for my niche:**
_________________________________________________

**I will position:**  
[ ] At market  
[ ] Above market (premium positioning)  
[ ] Below market (volume to build reviews)

**Why:**
_________________________________________________

**AI tip:** Ask ChatGPT: *"What are typical Fiverr or Upwork rates for [your service]? Give a range for beginners vs experienced sellers."* Use this as a starting point; then check live gigs in your category.

## Part 3: Pricing Models

### How you charge

**I will use:**  
[ ] Fixed per project  
[ ] Hourly  
[ ] Package tiers (Basic / Standard / Premium)

**Why this model fits my service and clients:**
_________________________________________________

For Level 1 (part-time side hustle), package tiers or fixed per project are usually easier to sell on Fiverr than hourly.

## Part 4: Packages and Tiers

### Define your Basic, Standard, and Premium (or single package)

**Basic:**  
Deliverables: _________________________________________________  
Price: $_________  
Delivery: _________ days  

**Standard:**  
Deliverables: _________________________________________________  
Price: $_________  
Delivery: _________ days  

**Premium:**  
Deliverables: _________________________________________________  
Price: $_________  
Delivery: _________ days  

**Add-ons (optional):**  
_________________________________________________

Align these with the [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md) and the Pricing Calculator Worksheet (PDF). Make sure each tier is clearly different (scope, delivery time, or extras) so buyers can choose easily.
