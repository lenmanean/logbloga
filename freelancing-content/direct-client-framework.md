# Direct Client Framework

Guided framework for acquiring and serving direct clients so you can win and retain them at $4,000–$10,000+/month—beyond marketplaces.

## Purpose

This framework helps you define your ideal direct client and offer, plan outreach and pipeline (channels, sequence, CRM stages), structure discovery and proposal, and close and retain clients with contracts, onboarding, and follow-up. Use it when you're ready to build a direct pipeline and reduce reliance on platforms.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 45–60 minutes  
- **When:** Early in Level 3 (Phase 2 of the [Implementation Plan](freelancing-level-3-plan.md)); after or alongside [Consultant Positioning](consultant-positioning-framework.md).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to draft outreach email sequences or proposal outlines from your fill-ins; then personalize for each prospect.

Complete each part in order. Use the results with the [Direct Client Acquisition Guide](direct-client-acquisition-guide.md) (outreach, discovery, closing) and the [CRM Setup Guide](crm-setup-guide.md) (pipeline stages and follow-up). Use [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) and [Business Systems Templates](business-systems-templates.zip) (ZIP) from this level for contracts and operations.

## Part 1: Ideal Client and Offer

### Define who you serve and what you offer

**Ideal direct client (industry, size, budget, who has authority to buy):**
_________________________________________________

**Where they are (LinkedIn, events, referrals, content, communities):**
_________________________________________________

**How they buy (who decides, timeline, what they compare you to):**
_________________________________________________

**Your offer for direct clients (project / retainer / both; outcome and scope):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Ideal: B2B SaaS founders, 5–50 employees, $5k–$20k project or $3k+/month retainer. They're on LinkedIn and in founder Slack groups; CEO or VP decides in 2–4 weeks. Offer: 90-day GTM project or ongoing positioning retainer."

## Part 2: Outreach and Pipeline

### Plan channels, sequence, and CRM stages

**Channels you'll use (e.g. LinkedIn, email, referrals, content, events):**
_________________________________________________

**Outreach sequence (e.g. connection → short value note → follow-up 1 → follow-up 2):**
_________________________________________________

**CRM stages you'll use (e.g. Lead, Contacted, Discovery scheduled, Proposal sent, Won, Lost):**
_________________________________________________

**How you'll nurture (e.g. value emails, case study, check-in every 2 weeks):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Channels: LinkedIn DMs and referrals. Sequence: connect + 1-line value → 3 days later short note with one tip → 5 days later ask for 15-min call. Stages: New lead, Replied, Call booked, Proposal sent, Won/Lost. Nurture: monthly useful email if no reply."

## Part 3: Discovery and Proposal

### Questions to ask and proposal structure

**Discovery questions (understand problem, timeline, budget, decision process):**
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

**Proposal structure (e.g. situation, approach, deliverables, timeline, investment):**
_________________________________________________

**How you'll send proposals (e.g. PDF + short email, or link to scope doc):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "Questions: What's the biggest bottleneck to launch? Who else is involved in the decision? What's the timeline? Proposal: 1-page situation/approach, deliverables list, 8–12 week timeline, investment and next step. Send as PDF with 3-line email."

---

## Part 4: Closing and Retention

### Contract, onboarding, and follow-up

**Contract (use Business Systems or Contract Templates):**  
- [ ] Scope and deliverables clear  
- [ ] Payment terms and schedule  
- [ ] Revision and ownership clauses  
- [ ] Signed before work starts  

**Onboarding (first 1–2 weeks):**  
_________________________________________________

**Ongoing follow-up (e.g. weekly updates, milestone check-ins, feedback request at delivery):**  
_________________________________________________

**Retention (e.g. end-of-project review, offer retainer or next project):**  
_________________________________________________

Use the [Direct Client Acquisition Guide](direct-client-acquisition-guide.md) for outreach sequence and closing. Use the [CRM Setup Guide](crm-setup-guide.md) to track deals and follow-up. Use [Business Systems Templates](business-systems-templates.zip) (ZIP) and [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (Level 2) for contracts and invoicing.
