## Section 2: Platform Costs

**Instructions:** List your monthly platform costs. For Level 3, aim to keep total platform costs in the $50–150 range (e.g. CRM, Hello Bonsai or similar, Stripe, Google Workspace, premium platforms, tools).

| Item            | Monthly cost ($) |
|-----------------|------------------|
| CRM            |                  |
| Contracts/Invoicing |              |
| Payment (Stripe, etc.) |        |
| Google Workspace |                 |
| Premium platforms / tools |     |
| Other           |                  |
| **Total**       |                  |

## Section 3: P&L-Style Summary

**Instructions:** Use a simple P&L (profit and loss) view: Revenue − Platform costs − Other expenses = Net. Update monthly so you see how revenue and costs track.

| Line item       | This month ($) | Notes        |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Revenue         |                | From Section 1 target / actual |
| − Platform costs|                | From Section 2 |
| − Other expenses|                | Software, marketing, tax set-aside |
| **Net**         |                | Revenue − costs − expenses |

## Section 4: Cash Flow

**Instructions:** Track when money comes in and goes out so you can plan for gaps. For consultants, project and retainer timing can create lumpy cash flow.

| Date / period   | In ($) | Out ($) | Running balance ($) |
|-----------------|--------|---------|---------------------|
|                 |        |         |                     |
|                 |        |         |                     |
|                 |        |         |                     |

## Section 5: Tax and Retirement

**Instructions:** Set aside a percentage of revenue for taxes (e.g. 25–35% depending on jurisdiction). Optionally allocate a portion to retirement (e.g. SEP-IRA, solo 401k). Track monthly so you're not surprised at tax time.

| Item            | Amount or % | This month ($) |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Tax set-aside   | _____ %     |                |
| Retirement       | _____ % or $|                |
| **Total set-aside** |        |                |
