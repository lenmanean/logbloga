# Hello Bonsai — Paid Features Setup

Step-by-step instructions for Hello Bonsai paid features so you can run contracts and invoicing at full-time volume ($1,500–$4,000/month).

## Overview

Hello Bonsai's paid plans add more contracts, automation, time tracking, and integrations—useful when you have multiple clients and want to reduce admin. For Level 2 full-time freelancing, paid features (or the free tier with limits) support more contracts, invoicing workflows, and client management. This guide walks you through upgrading (if you choose), advanced contracts, time tracking and projects, and integrations.

## Prerequisites

- Hello Bonsai account (free or paid from Level 1)
- Your service scope and typical contract terms (use [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) in this level)
- Optional: ChatGPT to draft contract clause bullets from your scope

**Time:** About 25–40 minutes (upgrade ~5 min; contracts and automation ~20 min; integrations ~10 min).

## Step 1: Upgrade to a Paid Plan (Optional)

**Time:** ~5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Choose a plan that fits your volume of contracts and invoices.

### Sub-steps

1. In Hello Bonsai, go to **Settings** or **Account** and find **Plan** or **Subscription**.
2. Compare plans: free tier vs paid (e.g. Workflow, Scale). Paid typically adds unlimited contracts, more automation, time tracking, and client portal.
3. If you're sending 5+ contracts or invoices per month, paid often pays for itself. Select the plan that fits and complete payment.
4. If you stay on free, note the limits (e.g. number of contracts per month) and use the [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) and [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md) to stay organized.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Plan chosen (free or paid); [ ] Limits understood

## Step 2: Advanced Contracts

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Use custom templates and clauses so every client gets a clear, consistent contract.

### Sub-step 2.1: Custom templates and clauses

1. Open **Contracts** (or **Templates**) in Bonsai.
2. Create or edit a **contract template** that matches your service: scope, deliverables, revision count, payment schedule, timeline. Use the [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) from this level for structure; then customize in Bonsai.
3. Add **reusable clauses** (e.g. confidentiality, IP ownership, termination) so you can drop them into new contracts without retyping.
4. **AI tip:** Paste your scope into ChatGPT and ask for 5–7 contract clause bullets; then add them to your Bonsai template.

### Sub-step 2.2: Automate renewals and amendments (if on paid)

1. If your plan supports it, set up **renewal** reminders for retainer or recurring contracts.
2. Use **amendments** for scope or timeline changes so everything stays in writing.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Contract template customized; [ ] Clauses in place; [ ] Renewals/amendments configured (if available)

## Step 3: Time Tracking and Projects

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Track time per project and tie it to invoicing (if you bill hourly or use time-based caps).

### Sub-steps

1. In Bonsai, open **Time Tracking** or **Projects**.
2. Create a **project** per client or per contract. Name it clearly (e.g. "Client X – Website Redesign").
3. Start **time tracking** when you work; stop when you pause. If you bill fixed price, you can still track for your own capacity planning.
4. If your plan supports it, **integrate time with invoicing** so hours flow into invoices. Otherwise, log time manually for your records.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Projects created for active clients; [ ] Time tracking in use (or manual log); [ ] Integration to invoicing set (if available)

---

## Step 4: Integrations

**Time:** ~5–10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Connect Bonsai to calendar, bank, and other tools for smoother operations.

### Sub-steps

1. In **Settings** or **Integrations**, connect your **calendar** (Google, Outlook) so Bonsai can suggest meeting times and avoid double-booking.
2. Connect **bank** or payment provider if Bonsai supports it for payouts or reconciliation.
3. Connect **Stripe** or **PayPal** if you use them for client payments and want them linked to Bonsai invoices (check your plan).
4. Use **labels or tags** (if available) to filter contracts and invoices by client or project.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Calendar connected; [ ] Bank/payment connected (if desired); [ ] Labels or tags in use (if available)
