# Hello Bonsai Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for Hello Bonsai: contracts, invoicing, and client management so you can protect scope, get paid on time, and look professional as a part-time freelancer.

## Overview

Hello Bonsai helps freelancers send contracts, create invoices, and manage clients in one place. For Level 1 ($500–$1,500/month, part-time), contracts clarify scope and payment terms—reducing scope creep and payment disputes. Invoicing gives you a clear record when you work with direct clients (outside Fiverr). This guide walks you through account setup, your first contract, invoicing, and where to manage projects—all with the free tier where possible.

## Prerequisites

- Email address  
- Your service description or gig scope (use your [Service Definition Framework](service-definition-framework.md) or gig description)  
- Optional: ChatGPT or Claude to turn your gig description into contract clause bullets  

**Time:** About 25–40 minutes (account ~5 min; first contract ~15–20 min; first invoice ~10 min).

## Step 1: Account Setup

**Time:** ~5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create your Hello Bonsai account and complete your profile so you can send contracts and invoices.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [hellobonsai.com](https://www.hellobonsai.com) (or search "Hello Bonsai") and click **Sign Up** or **Get Started**.
2. Sign up with **email** (or Google/Apple if offered). Use the same email you use for freelancing so everything is in one place.
3. Complete your **profile**: full name, and optionally business name. This appears on contracts and invoices.
4. If prompted, **connect your calendar** (Google, Outlook) so you can use scheduling features later. You can skip this for Level 1 if you only need contracts and invoices.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Account created; [ ] Profile completed; [ ] Calendar connected (optional)

## Step 2: Contracts

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create and send your first contract so scope, deliverables, revision count, and payment terms are in writing.

### Sub-step 2.1: Open contract templates

1. In Hello Bonsai, go to **Contracts** (or **Templates** > **Contracts**).
2. Browse or search for a template that fits freelancing (e.g. **Freelance Contract**, **Service Agreement**, or **Independent Contractor Agreement**).
3. Select the template and choose **Use this template** or **Create from template**.

### Sub-step 2.2: Customize the contract

1. **Parties:** Your name (or business name) as the freelancer; leave a slot for "Client name" or "Client company" so you can fill it when you send.
2. **Scope and deliverables:** Describe what you’re delivering (e.g. "One logo design with 2 revision rounds" or "One 500-word blog post, 1 revision"). Use your gig description or [Service Definition](service-definition-framework.md) so it matches what you sell on Fiverr.
3. **Revisions:** Specify how many revision rounds are included. This prevents scope creep.
4. **Payment schedule:** e.g. "50% upfront, 50% on delivery" or "100% on delivery." For Fiverr orders, the platform handles payment; use Bonsai contracts for direct clients or custom orders.
5. **Timeline:** Add delivery date or "X business days from project start."
6. **AI tip:** Paste your gig description into ChatGPT and ask: *"Turn this into 5–7 contract clause bullets (scope, deliverables, revisions, payment, timeline)."* Use those to fill in the Bonsai template.

### Sub-step 2.3: Add e-signature and send

1. Add an **e-signature** block for the client (and yourself if the template has two parties).
2. **Send** the contract: enter the client’s email and add a short message (e.g. "Please review and sign so we can get started.").
3. **Collect signature:** The client signs in their email or via link; you get a notification. Download a copy for your records.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Template chosen; [ ] Scope, revisions, payment, timeline filled; [ ] Contract sent; [ ] Signature collected (or pending)

## Step 3: Invoicing

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create and send your first invoice so you can get paid by direct clients and track payment status.

### Sub-steps

1. In Hello Bonsai, go to **Invoices** (or **Create** > **Invoice**).
2. **Create invoice:** Add client name/email, invoice number (Bonsai may auto-generate), and due date (e.g. Net 7 = payment due in 7 days).
3. **Line items:** Add description (e.g. "Logo design – Basic package"), quantity, and amount. Match the contract if you sent one.
4. **Payment terms:** Choose how the client pays (e.g. PayPal link, bank transfer, or Bonsai payment if available in your plan). For Level 1, many freelancers share their PayPal link or email—see the [PayPal Setup Guide](paypal-setup-guide.md).
5. **Send** the invoice by email. Track status (Sent, Viewed, Paid) in Bonsai.
6. **Remind:** If the client doesn’t pay by the due date, send a polite reminder (Bonsai may have a reminder option).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Invoice created; [ ] Line items and due date set; [ ] Invoice sent; [ ] Payment method clear to client

## Step 4: Client Management

**Time:** ~2–5 minutes (ongoing)  
**Purpose:** Know where to see your projects and clients so you can reuse contracts and invoices.

1. In Hello Bonsai, open **Projects** or **Clients** (name may vary by plan).
2. You’ll see a list of projects/clients. Click one to see linked contracts and invoices.
3. For **first orders** (especially on Fiverr), you may not need Bonsai for every order—Fiverr handles the transaction. Use Bonsai when you do custom work, direct clients, or need a formal contract. See the [First Client Acquisition Guide](freelancing-level-1-first-client-acquisition-guide.md) for when to send a contract (e.g. custom scope, direct client).
