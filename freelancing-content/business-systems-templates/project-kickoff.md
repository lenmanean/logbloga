# Project Kickoff Template

One-page agenda for the kickoff call with a new client. Use after contract and deposit; confirm scope and set first deliverables.

---

## 1. Intro (5 min)

- Introductions (you and the client; who's involved on their side).
- Agenda and goals for the call: confirm scope, timeline, and first deliverables.

## 2. Goals and success (5 min)

- What does the client want to achieve with this project? (e.g. launch a course, refresh the brand, 10 blog posts.)
- What does success look like when we're done? (One or two clear outcomes.)
- Any constraints or deadlines we need to plan around?

## 3. Scope and timeline (10 min)

- **Scope:** Recap what's in the contract (deliverables, revisions, meetings).
- **Timeline:** Start date; key milestones; final delivery date.
- **Process:** How you'll work (e.g. draft → client review → revision → final). How long they have to give feedback (e.g. 5 business days).

## 4. First deliverables (5 min)

- Agree on the first 2–4 deliverables and due dates.
- What you need from the client (access, content, assets) and by when.
- Next step: e.g. "I'll send the access request by [date]; first deliverable by [date]."

## 5. Communication and Q&A (5 min)

- How you'll communicate (email, Slack, etc.) and expected response time.
- Open questions from the client.
- Confirm next touchpoint (e.g. status update when first deliverable is ready).

**After the call:** Send a short summary email with agreed scope, dates, and next steps. Mark kickoff complete in your [client-onboarding-checklist.md](client-onboarding-checklist.md).
