# Client Onboarding Checklist

Use this when you land a new client so nothing is missed. Align with [Client Communication Templates](../client-communication-templates.md) and your contract (Hello Bonsai, etc.).

---

## Before kickoff

- [ ] **Contract signed** — Agreement or SOW signed by the client (e-signature or wet signature).
- [ ] **Deposit or first invoice paid** — Per your payment terms (e.g. 50% upfront for projects; first month for retainer).
- [ ] **Kickoff scheduled** — Call on the calendar; agenda ready (goals, scope, timeline, first deliverables).
- [ ] **Access and assets** — List what you need (logins, brand kit, content); send request to client with due date.

## After kickoff

- [ ] **Kickoff held** — Call completed; scope and timeline confirmed.
- [ ] **First deliverables scheduled** — Dates set for the first 2–4 deliverables.
- [ ] **Client in your system** — Contact and project in your CRM, task tool, or spreadsheet (e.g. Hello Bonsai, Notion, Google Sheet).
- [ ] **Communication channel** — Where you'll communicate (email, Slack, etc.) and response expectations (e.g. 24–48 hours).

## Optional

- [ ] **Welcome email** — Short email after kickoff with summary, next steps, and how to reach you.
- [ ] **Project doc or brief** — One-pager with scope, milestones, and contact info so you and the client can refer back.
