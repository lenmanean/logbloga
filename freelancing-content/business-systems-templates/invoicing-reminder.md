# Invoicing and Follow-Up Reminder

Use this to stay on top of invoicing and payment follow-up so you don't leave money on the table or wait too long for payment.

---

## When to invoice

- **Fixed project:** Per contract (e.g. 50% upfront before start; 50% on delivery). Send the final invoice when you deliver the final deliverable.
- **Retainer:** Invoice at the start of each month (or per your cycle). Send X days before the due date so the client has time to pay.
- **Milestone:** Send invoice when the milestone is complete and approved; payment due per terms (e.g. Net 15).

## Invoice contents

- **From/To:** Your name or business; client name or company.
- **Invoice number:** Unique ID (e.g. INV-001).
- **Date and due date:** Invoice date; payment due date (e.g. Net 15 = 15 days from invoice date).
- **Line items:** Description of work (e.g. "Project fee – 10 blog posts" or "Retainer – January 2025"); amount.
- **Total:** Amount due.
- **Payment method:** How to pay (e.g. link to Stripe/Hello Bonsai, bank transfer, check).
- **Terms:** e.g. "Payment due within 15 days. Late payments subject to [X]% interest per month."

## Follow-up sequence (if unpaid)

- **Day 0:** Invoice sent.
- **Day 7 (or 3 days before due):** Friendly reminder: "Just checking in – invoice #X is due on [date]. Let me know if you have any questions."
- **Day 15 (or on due date):** Second reminder: "Invoice #X was due today. Please remit payment at your earliest convenience. Here's the link again: [link]."
- **Day 21 (or 7 days late):** Third reminder: "Invoice #X is now 7 days past due. We need to receive payment by [date] to avoid pausing work / late fees per our agreement."
- **Beyond:** Per your policy (e.g. pause work, late fee, or escalation). Keep communication professional and documented.

## Tips

- Use Hello Bonsai, Stripe Invoicing, or similar so you have a clear record and payment link.
- Set a recurring reminder (weekly or biweekly) to check for unpaid invoices.
- Document all follow-up (email, date) in case you need to escalate or small-claims.
