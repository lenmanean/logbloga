# Profile Optimization Checklist (Level 1)

Checklist to optimize your freelancing profile (Fiverr or similar) for visibility and conversions. Expand each checkbox with short instructions so you know exactly what to do.

## Profile

- [ ] **Professional photo**  
  - Use a clear headshot: neutral background, face visible, good lighting. Avoid logos or busy images for the main profile photo. If needed, use a phone with good light or a simple Canva/AI background (within platform rules).

- [ ] **Clear bio and tagline**  
  - Length: 1–2 lines (or platform limit). Include who you help, what you deliver, and why they should choose you. Use your one-sentence positioning from the [Service Definition Framework](service-definition-framework.md). No spam, links to other platforms, or prohibited content.

- [ ] **Skills and language set**  
  - Add 2–3 skills that match your service (e.g. Logo Design, Copywriting). Set your language(s) and level (e.g. English – Fluent). For Level 1, keep skills focused so you’re easy to find.

- [ ] **Verification completed**  
  - Complete any platform verification (e.g. email, phone, ID) so your account is trusted and limits are higher. Have ID and bank details ready if prompted.

## Gigs

- [ ] **Clear gig title**  
  - Use the formula "I will [deliverable] for [niche]" and include your primary keyword. Stay under the platform character limit (e.g. Fiverr 80 characters). See the [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md).

- [ ] **Clear gig description**  
  - Structure: hook (what you deliver, who it’s for), benefits (bullets), process (how you work), call to action. Align with your [Service Definition Framework](service-definition-framework.md) and [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md).

- [ ] **Relevant keywords and category**  
  - Primary keyword in title and first line of description. Search tags use the same theme (no repetition). Category and subcategory match your service so buyers find you when browsing or filtering.

- [ ] **Pricing and packages set**  
  - Basic / Standard / Premium (or single package) with clear deliverables and delivery time per tier. Add-ons if relevant. Align with your [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md).

- [ ] **Gig images or video added**  
  - Minimum 1 image; recommend 3 (sample work, process, or professional graphic). Clear, high-quality; no watermarks that violate platform rules. Video optional but can improve conversion if done well.

- [ ] **FAQ filled in**  
  - Top 5 questions to answer: What do I need to provide? How many revisions? Delivery time? What’s included in each package? Any other common buyer question. Short, clear answers. Reduces back-and-forth and builds trust.

## Ongoing

- [ ] **Respond to messages promptly**  
  - Target: under 24 hours; ideally 2–4 hours for new inquiries. Set notifications so you don’t miss messages. Fast response improves conversion and buyer trust.

- [ ] **Deliver on time and request feedback**  
  - Deliver on or before the deadline. If you’ll be late, message the buyer early with a new date. After delivery, send a polite request for a review (per platform rules).

- [ ] **Update gigs based on performance**  
  - If you get no orders: revisit title, description, keywords, pricing, or images (see [Common Freelancing Issues](freelancing-level-1-common-freelancing-issues.md)). If you get too many or feel underpaid: use the [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md) and consider raising prices or delivery time. Refresh gig copy or images every few months if needed.
