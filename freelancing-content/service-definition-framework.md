# Service Definition Framework

Guided exercises to define your freelancing service and niche so buyers and the platform understand you clearly. Completing this framework is critical for reaching your first $500–$1,500/month—it drives your gig title, description, and positioning.

## Purpose

A clear service definition helps buyers and algorithms (e.g. Fiverr search) understand what you offer and who you help. One focused service and niche makes it easier to write compelling gig copy, set pricing, and win your first orders. Without it, your profile and gigs feel generic and underperform.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 20–30 minutes  
- **When:** Complete before creating your gigs (Phase 1 of the Implementation Plan).  
- **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT or Claude to generate options (e.g. 5 service ideas from your skills), then choose and personalize. Don't publish AI output verbatim—make it yours.

Complete each part in order. Use your answers in the [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md) and in Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](freelancing-level-1-plan.md).

## Part 1: Skills and Experience

### What you can deliver consistently

**I am skilled at:**
_________________________________________________

**I have experience in:**

## Part 2: Target Client and Niche

### Who you help and what problem you solve

**My ideal client is:**
_________________________________________________

**They need:**
_________________________________________________

**I solve this by:**
_________________________________________________

**Niche (industry or audience):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "My ideal client is a small business owner who needs a professional logo. They need a simple, memorable logo for their brand. I solve this by designing a logo package (primary logo, icon, usage guide). Niche: small businesses and startups."

## Part 3: Service Packaging

### Your core deliverable, scope, and boundaries

**My core deliverable is:**
_________________________________________________

**Scope (what's included):**
_________________________________________________

**Typical delivery time:**
_________________________________________________

**I do NOT offer (boundaries):**
_________________________________________________

Use this to set your gig packages and FAQ (e.g. revision count, what's in/out of scope).

## Part 4: Positioning

### One sentence that sums up your value

**Value proposition formula:** *For [target client] who [need], I [deliverable] that [benefit].*

**Your value proposition (one sentence):**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** "For small business owners who need a professional brand, I design logos and basic brand guides that look polished and are ready to use."

Use this sentence in your Fiverr bio and in the first line of your gig description. It also feeds into your gig title (e.g. "I will design a professional logo for small businesses").
