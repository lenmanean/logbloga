# Direct Client Acquisition Guide

Step-by-step guide to finding and closing direct clients beyond marketplaces so you can reach $4,000–$10,000+/month as a premium consultant.

## Overview

Direct clients are those you find and work with outside of Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, or other marketplaces. You own the relationship, set pricing, and use your own systems (proposals, contracts, CRM). This guide covers where to find direct clients (LinkedIn, referrals, content, events), outreach sequence, discovery and proposal, closing, and how to use your CRM. Time: about 60–90 minutes to read and apply; ongoing for outreach and follow-up. This supports Level 3 platform costs in the $50–150/month range when you add CRM and tools.

## Prerequisites

- [Consultant Positioning Framework](consultant-positioning-framework.md) completed or in progress (positioning statement, ideal client, offer)
- [Direct Client Framework](direct-client-framework.md) completed or in progress (ideal client, outreach, pipeline)
- Optional: CRM set up per [CRM Setup Guide](crm-setup-guide.md)

## Step 1: Where to Find Direct Clients

**Time:** ~20–30 minutes to plan  
**Purpose:** Identify channels that match your ideal client and how they buy.

### Sub-step 1.1: LinkedIn

1. **Profile:** Your LinkedIn should reflect your positioning (headline, summary, experience, recommendations). Use the [Premium Positioning Guide](freelancing-level-3-premium-positioning-guide.md) for messaging.
2. **Search:** Use LinkedIn search to find decision-makers in your niche (e.g. founders, VPs, hiring managers). Filter by industry, company size, and role.
3. **Warmth:** Prioritize 2nd-degree connections and people who engage with your content. Comment and share value before pitching.
4. **Outreach:** Connect with a short, value-led note (not a sales pitch). Follow up with one tip or resource, then ask for a short call. See Step 2 for sequence.

### Sub-step 1.2: Referrals

1. **Ask:** After delivering results, ask happy clients: "Who else do you know who might be facing [problem]?" Make it easy—one sentence they can forward.
2. **Partners:** Complementary service providers (e.g. dev shop, agency, coach) can refer clients. See [Partnership Strategies](freelancing-level-3-partnership-strategies.md).
3. **Track:** Log referrals in your CRM so you can thank people and follow up.

### Sub-step 1.3: Content and events

1. **Content:** Articles, LinkedIn posts, or videos that demonstrate expertise attract inbound leads. Align with your [Consultant Positioning Framework](consultant-positioning-framework.md) thought leadership plan.
2. **Events:** Webinars, conferences, or community events where your ideal clients show up. Speak or host to increase visibility.
3. **Follow-up:** Add contacts to your CRM and nurture with value (e.g. share a relevant resource, invite to a webinar).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Channels chosen (LinkedIn, referrals, content, events); [ ] Ideal client and decision-maker clear; [ ] First list of prospects or partners identified

## Step 2: Outreach Sequence

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes to design; ongoing to execute  
**Purpose:** A repeatable sequence so you don't rely on one touch.

### Sub-steps

1. **Touch 1:** Connection or first email—short, value-led (e.g. "I noticed [X]; here's one idea that might help: [tip]."). No long pitch.
2. **Touch 2:** 3–5 days later—one more piece of value (e.g. case study, article, or tool). "Thought you might find this useful."
3. **Touch 3:** 5–7 days later—soft ask. "Would a 15-minute call be useful to discuss [problem]? No pitch—just a conversation."
4. **Touch 4+:** If no reply, one more follow-up in 2 weeks; then move to long-term nurture (e.g. monthly value email) or mark in CRM as cold for now.
5. **CRM:** Log every touch in your [CRM Setup Guide](crm-setup-guide.md) pipeline (e.g. Lead → Contacted → Replied → Discovery scheduled). Use deal and contact fields so you don't lose track.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Sequence written (4+ touches); [ ] First 5–10 prospects in CRM; [ ] First touches sent

## Step 3: Discovery and Proposal

**Time:** ~30–45 minutes per prospect (discovery call + proposal)  
**Purpose:** Understand the client's situation and present a clear, consultant-level proposal.

### Sub-step 3.1: Discovery call

1. **Goal:** Understand problem, timeline, budget, and decision process. Use questions from the [Direct Client Framework](direct-client-framework.md) Part 3.
2. **Listen:** Spend more time listening than pitching. Note pain points, success criteria, and who else is involved in the decision.
3. **Next step:** Agree on next step (e.g. "I'll send a one-page proposal by Friday with approach, deliverables, timeline, and investment.").

### Sub-step 3.2: Proposal

1. **Structure:** Situation (what you heard), approach (how you'll solve it), deliverables (what they get), timeline, investment, and next step. Use your [Consultant Positioning Framework](consultant-positioning-framework.md) and [Premium Pricing Models](freelancing-level-3-premium-pricing-models.md).
2. **Format:** PDF or shared doc with a short email. Keep it scannable; avoid long paragraphs.
3. **Send:** Send on time; add a calendar invite for a follow-up call if they're interested. Log in CRM as "Proposal sent."

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Discovery questions ready; [ ] Proposal template or structure in place; [ ] At least one discovery call completed; [ ] At least one proposal sent

## Step 4: Closing

**Time:** Varies per deal  
**Purpose:** Get to a signed contract and first payment.

### Sub-steps

1. **Follow up:** If no response in 3–5 days, send a brief follow-up (e.g. "Wanted to check if you had any questions on the proposal.").
2. **Objections:** Handle pricing or scope questions with clarity on value and outcomes. Offer options (e.g. phased project, retainer) if useful.
3. **Contract:** Use your contract template (Business Systems or Contract Templates). Scope, payment terms, and revisions clear. Signed before work starts.
4. **CRM:** Move deal to "Won" in pipeline; add client to active clients. Set reminder for onboarding and first deliverable.

**What you'll have when done:** A clear process for finding direct clients, an outreach sequence, discovery and proposal flow, and closing with contracts. Use the [Direct Client Framework](direct-client-framework.md) and [CRM Setup Guide](crm-setup-guide.md) to keep pipeline and follow-up consistent.
