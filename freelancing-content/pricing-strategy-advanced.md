# Pricing Strategy Advanced

Guided exercises to set pricing for full-time freelancing so you reach $1,500–$4,000/month without undercharging or losing clients.

## Purpose

At full-time volume, pricing must cover your hours, platform fees, taxes, and overhead while positioning you at or above market. This worksheet helps you factor in cost and capacity, market positioning, packages and retainers, and when to scale—so you earn consistently and know when to raise rates.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 30–45 minutes  
- **When:** Complete in Phase 1 of the [Implementation Plan](freelancing-level-2-plan.md); use with the [Pricing Scaling Strategy](freelancing-level-2-pricing-scaling-strategy.md) (MD) and [Full-Time Budget Planner](freelancing-level-2-full-time-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section.  
- **AI tip:** Ask ChatGPT for typical Upwork or market rates for your role and niche; use as a starting point, then set your own floor and positioning.

Complete each part below. Use the results when setting Upwork rates, direct-client packages, and retainer scope.

## Part 1: Cost and Capacity

### Hours per week and multiple deliverables

**Billable hours per week (realistic):**
_________________________________________________

**Platform fees (e.g. Upwork 10–20%, payment processing):**
_________________________________________________

**Tax and overhead (e.g. 20–30%):**
_________________________________________________

**Minimum effective hourly rate (after fees and tax) to hit $1,500–$4,000/month:**
_________________________________________________

**Example:** 25 billable hrs/week × 4 weeks = 100 hrs/month. To earn $3,000 after ~25% total deductions, need ~$4,000 gross → $40/hr effective minimum.

## Part 2: Market and Competitors

### Position at or above market

**3 competitors' rates (hourly or project):**
1. _________________________________________________  
2. _________________________________________________  
3. _________________________________________________

**Market range for my niche and experience:**
_________________________________________________

**I will position:** [ ] At market [ ] Above market (premium) [ ] Slightly below to fill pipeline (then raise)

**Why:**
_________________________________________________

## Part 3: Packages and Retainers

### Recurring vs project work

**I will use:** [ ] Mostly project-based [ ] Mix of project and retainer [ ] Mostly retainer

Deliverables: _________________________________________________  
Price: $_________ Delivery: _________  

**Retainer (if used):**  
Scope: _________________________________________________  
Monthly rate: $_________ Communication cadence: _________

**Why this mix fits my clients and capacity:**
_________________________________________________

## Part 4: Scaling

### When to raise rates

**I will consider raising rates when:**  
[ ] Capacity is full (e.g. 80%+ booked)  
[ ] I've completed X projects in this niche: _________  
[ ] Client feedback and outcomes justify premium  
[ ] Market rates have increased  

**How much to raise (e.g. 10–20%):** _________________________________________________

**How to communicate:** Use the [Pricing Scaling Strategy](freelancing-level-2-pricing-scaling-strategy.md) for when and how to communicate rate changes to existing and new clients.
