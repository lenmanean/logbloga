# CRM Setup Guide (Freelancers)

Step-by-step CRM setup for freelancers and consultants (e.g. HubSpot, GoHighLevel) so you can manage pipeline and follow-up for direct clients—supporting $4,000–$10,000+/month.

## Overview

A CRM (customer relationship management) tool helps you track leads, deals, and clients in one place. For Level 3, you need pipeline stages (e.g. Lead, Contacted, Proposal sent, Won, Lost), contact and deal fields, optional automation for follow-up, and integration with email or calendar so nothing falls through the cracks. This guide walks you through choosing a product, setting up pipeline and fields, and connecting your workflow. Time: about 60–90 minutes for initial setup. Platform costs for Level 3 typically include CRM in the $50–150/month range.

## Prerequisites

- Clarity on your sales process (see [Direct Client Framework](direct-client-framework.md) and [Direct Client Acquisition Guide](direct-client-acquisition-guide.md))
- Email account you use for outreach (for integration)
- Optional: Calendar (Google, Outlook) for meeting links and reminders

**When to use:** When you're actively pursuing direct clients and need a single place to track leads and deals. Use with the [Direct Client Acquisition Guide](direct-client-acquisition-guide.md) and [Business Systems Templates](README.md) (ZIP) for consistency.

## Step 1: Choose a CRM Product

**Time:** ~20–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Pick a CRM that fits freelancers/consultants and your budget.

### Sub-steps

1. **Options:** HubSpot (free tier and paid), GoHighLevel, Pipedrive, or similar. Many have free or low-cost tiers for freelancers with limited contacts/deals.
2. **Consider:** Number of contacts and deals you need, email integration, pipeline views, and mobile access. For Level 3, pipeline and contact/deal fields are essential; automation is optional but helpful.
3. **Sign up:** Create an account and complete basic profile (name, email, time zone).

**What you'll have:** A CRM account ready for pipeline and field setup.

## Step 2: Set Up Pipeline Stages

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Stages that match your direct client process so you can move deals and see what's stuck.

### Sub-steps

1. **Default stages:** Many CRMs ship with stages like Lead, Contacted, Qualified, Proposal sent, Negotiation, Won, Lost. Rename or add to match your process.
2. **Suggested for freelancers:** Lead → Contacted → Replied → Discovery scheduled → Proposal sent → Won / Lost. Adjust to your [Direct Client Framework](direct-client-framework.md) Part 2.
3. **Visibility:** Ensure you can see all deals in a board or list view and filter by stage. Use this weekly to prioritize follow-up.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Pipeline stages created; [ ] Names match your process; [ ] Board or list view available

## Step 3: Contact and Deal Fields

**Time:** ~20–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Capture the right information so you can personalize outreach and track deal value.

### Sub-step 3.1: Contact fields

1. **Standard:** Name, email, phone (optional), company, role. Add custom fields if needed (e.g. source: LinkedIn, referral, event).
2. **Use:** When logging a new lead, fill in source and any notes so you know where they came from and what to reference in outreach.

### Sub-step 3.2: Deal fields

1. **Standard:** Deal name (e.g. "Acme Co – positioning project"), value (fee), stage, close date. Add custom fields if needed (e.g. service type: project vs retainer).
2. **Use:** Update stage when you send a proposal, have a discovery call, or close. Use value to forecast revenue and prioritize high-value deals.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Contact fields set; [ ] Deal fields set; [ ] At least one test contact and deal created and moved through stages

## Step 4: Automation (Optional)

**Time:** ~15–25 minutes  
**Purpose:** Remind yourself to follow up so leads don't go cold.

### Sub-steps

1. **Task reminders:** When a deal is in "Contacted" or "Proposal sent," create a task to follow up in 3–5 days. Many CRMs support this with workflows or tasks.
2. **Status updates:** Optional: send yourself a weekly summary of deals by stage (e.g. "5 in Proposal sent, 3 in Contacted"). Use built-in reports or email digests if available.
3. **Keep it simple:** Start with 1–2 automations; add more once you're used to the CRM. Don't over-automate before you have a steady pipeline.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] One follow-up reminder or task automation set; [ ] Tested with a sample deal

## Step 5: Integration with Email and Calendar

**Time:** ~10–15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Log emails and meetings so you have context in one place.

### Sub-steps

1. **Email:** Connect your outreach email (Gmail, Outlook) so you can log emails to contacts or deals, or so sent emails are tracked. Not all CRMs support this on free tiers; enable if available.
2. **Calendar:** Connect Google Calendar or Outlook so you can schedule meetings from the CRM or see upcoming calls. Reduces context-switching.
3. **Use:** After a discovery call or send of a proposal, log a note on the deal and move the stage. After a client email, log it on the contact or deal.

**What you'll have when done:** A CRM with pipeline stages, contact and deal fields, optional automation for follow-up, and email/calendar integration. Use it with the [Direct Client Acquisition Guide](direct-client-acquisition-guide.md) to track every lead and deal, and with [Business Systems Templates](README.md) (ZIP) for consistent processes.
