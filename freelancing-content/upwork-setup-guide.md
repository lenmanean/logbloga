# Upwork Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for Upwork: profile, proposals, and Job Success Score (JSS) so you can win jobs and move toward $1,500–$4,000/month as a full-time freelancer.

## Overview

Upwork is a marketplace where clients post jobs and freelancers send proposals. Your profile (photo, headline, overview, work history, portfolio) and proposal quality drive whether you get hired. For Level 2 full-time freelancing, a complete profile and targeted proposals help you win more jobs and maintain a strong Job Success Score (JSS), which improves visibility and trust. This guide walks you through account creation, profile optimization, proposals, and JSS—within Level 2 time investment (3–4 weeks) and platform costs ($20–50/month).

## Prerequisites

- Email address (or social login)
- Professional photo and portfolio or work samples
- Overview and work history (use the [Professional Portfolio Framework](professional-portfolio-framework.md) in this level if needed)
- Optional: ChatGPT or Claude for proposal drafts

**Time:** About 60–90 minutes total (account and profile ~45 min; first proposal ~15–30 min).

## Step 1: Create Your Profile

**Time:** ~20–30 minutes  
**Purpose:** Sign up and complete your Upwork profile so you can send proposals and be found by clients.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com) and click **Sign Up** (or **Get Started**).
2. Sign up with **email** or **social login**. Use an email you check regularly—Upwork sends job and message notifications.
3. Choose **Find Work** (freelancer) so you're set up to send proposals.
4. Complete **skills**: add skills that match your niche (e.g. React, Copywriting, Logo Design). Upwork may suggest skills; pick the most relevant 2–4 for Level 2.
5. Add **overview**: 2–4 paragraphs on who you are, who you help, what you deliver, and why clients should hire you. Use your positioning from the [Professional Portfolio Framework](professional-portfolio-framework.md) or [Pricing Strategy Advanced](pricing-strategy-advanced.md).
6. Add **work history** (if you have prior roles or freelance work) and **portfolio** link or uploads. Link to your portfolio site or attach 3–5 samples.
7. Verify your identity if Upwork prompts (e.g. ID, phone). Verified profiles get higher trust.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Account created; [ ] Skills and overview added; [ ] Work history and portfolio in place; [ ] Identity verified (if prompted)

## Step 2: Profile Optimization

**Time:** ~15–20 minutes  
**Purpose:** Make your profile stand out so clients invite you or respond to your proposals.

### Sub-step 2.1: Professional photo and headline

1. Upload a **profile photo**: clear headshot, neutral background, face visible. Avoid logos for the main photo.
2. Write a **headline** (one line): role + niche or outcome (e.g. "React Developer | SaaS MVP in 6–8 weeks"). Stay within Upwork's character limit.

### Sub-step 2.2: Compelling overview and work history

1. **Overview:** First 1–2 sentences should say what you do and who you help. Use bullets for key outcomes or deliverables. End with a short call to action (e.g. "Message me to discuss your project.").
2. **Work history:** Add past roles or projects with title, duration, and 1–2 lines of responsibility or outcome. Keep it relevant to the work you're seeking.

### Sub-step 2.3: Hourly rate and availability

1. Set your **hourly rate** (or rate range). Align with your [Pricing Strategy Advanced](pricing-strategy-advanced.md)—don't undercut yourself for full-time revenue.
2. Set **availability** (e.g. full-time, part-time, hours per week) so clients know your capacity.
3. Choose **categories** that match your skills so you appear in the right job searches.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Photo and headline set; [ ] Overview and work history compelling; [ ] Hourly rate and availability set; [ ] Categories correct

## Step 3: Proposals

**Time:** ~15–30 minutes per proposal  
**Purpose:** Write targeted proposals that win jobs without violating Upwork policies.

### Sub-step 3.1: Read the job and requirements

1. Read the full job description, budget, and timeline.
2. Note must-haves and nice-to-haves so your proposal addresses them.
3. Check if the client has a history (reviews, payment verified) so you can tailor tone and expectations.

### Sub-step 3.2: Structure your proposal

1. **Opening:** One sentence that shows you read the job (e.g. "I see you need [X] for [context].").
2. **Relevant experience:** 2–3 bullets or short paragraph on similar work and outcomes. Use the [Professional Portfolio Framework](professional-portfolio-framework.md) case studies if they fit.
3. **Approach:** How you'll deliver (e.g. "I'll start with a kickoff call, then deliver the first draft in 5 days.").
4. **Close:** One line with a question or next step (e.g. "When's a good time for a quick call?").
5. **Length:** Keep within Upwork's proposal character limit; avoid walls of text. **AI tip:** Use ChatGPT to draft 2–3 proposal versions; then personalize with client name and job details. Never send AI output verbatim.

### Sub-step 3.3: Follow Upwork policies

1. No off-platform contact before a contract (e.g. don't ask for email or phone in the first message unless the job allows it).
2. No copy-paste generic proposals; personalize each one.
3. No false claims; keep experience and outcomes accurate.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Job read and requirements noted; [ ] Proposal structured (opening, experience, approach, close); [ ] Personalized; [ ] Policies followed

## Step 4: Job Success Score (JSS)

**Time:** Ongoing  
**Purpose:** Understand and maintain your JSS so you stay visible and win more jobs.

### Sub-steps

1. **What JSS is:** Upwork's Job Success Score (0–100%) reflects contract outcomes, client feedback, and responsiveness. A high JSS improves your visibility in search and in client invites.
2. **How to maintain it:** Deliver on time, communicate clearly, and resolve issues professionally. Use the [Client Communication Templates](client-communication-templates.md) and [Client Management Issues](freelancing-level-2-client-management-issues.md) for scope and communication.
3. **Contract outcomes:** Complete contracts successfully; avoid disputes. Use contracts (e.g. [Hello Bonsai Paid Setup](hello-bonsai-paid-setup.md)) to lock in scope and payment for direct or custom work.
4. **Feedback:** After each job, request feedback (within Upwork's rules). Positive feedback and a high JSS compound over time.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] JSS understood; [ ] Delivery and communication habits in place; [ ] Feedback requested where appropriate
