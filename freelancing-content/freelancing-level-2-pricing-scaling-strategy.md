# Pricing Scaling Strategy (Level 2)

How to scale pricing as you move to full-time freelancing so you reach $1,500–$4,000/month without losing clients.

## Purpose

As you fill capacity and deliver strong outcomes, you can raise rates for new clients and (with care) for existing ones. This guide helps you decide when to scale, how much to raise, how to communicate, and how to evolve packages—so you grow revenue without burning out or losing good clients.

## How to Use

- **Time:** 20–30 minutes to plan; then ongoing (review quarterly or when capacity is full).  
- **When:** Use with the [Pricing Strategy Advanced](pricing-strategy-advanced.md) (Creative Framework) and the [Full-Time Budget Planner](freelancing-level-2-full-time-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section.  
- **Cross-ref:** Use the [Proposal Templates](proposal-templates.zip) and [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (ZIP) when presenting new rates or updating contracts.

Complete each part below. Use the results when you set new client rates and when you communicate changes to existing clients.

## Part 1: Current Pricing

### Review your current rates and packages

**Current hourly rate (or average project price):**
_________________________________________________

**Current packages (e.g. Basic / Standard / Premium):**
_________________________________________________

**Compare to market:** Use the [Pricing Strategy Advanced](pricing-strategy-advanced.md) Part 2 (Market and competitors). Note: _________________________________________________

**Compare to your costs:** Use the [Full-Time Budget Planner](freelancing-level-2-full-time-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) from the Planning section. Minimum effective rate after platform costs and tax: _________________________________________________

**Room to increase without losing clients:**  
[ ] I'm below market → I can raise for new clients  
[ ] I'm at market → I can raise when capacity is full or outcomes justify it  
[ ] I'm above market → I'll hold or add value (retainer, priority) to justify

**Notes:** _________________________________________________

## Part 2: New Clients, New Rates

### Raise rates for new clients first

**When to raise for new clients:**  
[ ] Capacity is 80%+ full  
[ ] I've completed X projects in this niche: _________  
[ ] Market rates have increased  
[ ] My outcomes and testimonials justify premium  

**How much to raise (e.g. 10–20%):**
_________________________________________________

**How to present value:** Use the [Proposal Templates](proposal-templates.zip) (ZIP) in this level. Lead with outcomes (e.g. "I'll deliver [X] in [Y] days so you can [outcome]"). Align pricing with outcomes, not hours, where possible.

**New rate (hourly or project):** _________________________________________________

**Testing checklist:** [ ] New rate set; [ ] Proposal template updated; [ ] First new client at new rate

## Part 3: Existing Clients

### Communicate rate changes in advance

**When to raise for existing clients:**  
[ ] At contract renewal or new project  
[ ] After 6–12 months of consistent work  
[ ] When I'm adding value (e.g. retainer, priority support)  

**How to communicate:**  
1. Give advance notice (e.g. 30 days before renewal or next project).  
2. State the new rate and effective date.  
3. Offer value in exchange (e.g. "I'm raising my rate to $X/hr. In return, you'll get [priority support / monthly check-in / etc.]").  
4. Use the [Contract Templates](contract-templates.zip) (ZIP) for updates; send an amendment or new contract via [Hello Bonsai Paid Setup](hello-bonsai-paid-setup.md) if needed.

**Script (placeholder):**  
"Hi [Client], I'm updating my rates effective [date]. For our work together, my new rate will be [X]. I'm also [adding value, e.g. monthly check-in]. If you have questions, let's chat."

**Notes:** _________________________________________________

## Part 4: Packaging Evolution

### Move from hourly to fixed or retainer where possible

**I will move to (or add):**  
[ ] Fixed per project (clear scope, one price)  
[ ] Retainer (recurring monthly scope)  
[ ] Hybrid (fixed for projects, retainer for ongoing support)  

**Why this fits my clients and capacity:**
_________________________________________________

**When to introduce:**  
[ ] At next new project  
[ ] At renewal for existing clients  
[ ] When client asks for ongoing support  

**Cross-ref:** Use the [Pricing Strategy Advanced](pricing-strategy-advanced.md) Part 3 (Packages and retainers) and Part 4 (Scaling) for structure. Use the [Full-Time Budget Planner](freelancing-level-2-full-time-budget-planner.pdf) (PDF) for numbers.
