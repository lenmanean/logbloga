# Pricing Scaling Strategy (Level 2)

How to scale pricing as you move to full-time freelancing.

## 1. Current Pricing

- Review your current rates and packages
- Compare to market and your costs (use Full-Time Budget Planner PDF in this level)
- Identify room to increase without losing clients

## 2. New Clients, New Rates

- Raise rates for new clients first
- Use Proposal Templates (ZIP) in this level to present value
- Align pricing with outcomes, not hours

## 3. Existing Clients

- Communicate rate changes in advance
- Offer value (e.g. retainer, priority) in exchange
- Use Contract Templates (ZIP) in this level for updates

## 4. Packaging

- Move from hourly to fixed or retainer where possible
- Use the Pricing Strategy Advanced (Creative Framework) in this level

See the Full-Time Budget Planner (PDF) in this level for numbers.
