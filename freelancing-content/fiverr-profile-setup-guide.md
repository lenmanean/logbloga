# Fiverr Profile Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for setting up your Fiverr profile, gigs, and optimization so you can win your first orders and move toward $500–$1,500/month as a part-time freelancer.

## Overview

Fiverr is a marketplace where buyers order services (gigs) from sellers. Your profile and gigs are your storefront. A complete profile (photo, bio, skills) and at least one well-optimized gig (title, description, pricing, images, FAQ) make you visible in search and build trust. This guide walks you through account creation, profile completion, first gig creation, and basic search optimization—all within Level 1 time investment (1–2 weeks) and platform costs ($0–20/month).

## Prerequisites

- Email address (or social account for sign-up)
- Professional or clear headshot (neutral background, face visible)
- One-sentence positioning or bio (use the [Service Definition Framework](service-definition-framework.md) in this level if needed)
- Optional: ChatGPT or Claude for bio/gig copy options; Canva (free) for gig images

**Time:** About 45–90 minutes total (account and profile ~20 min; first gig ~45–60 min; optimization ~15 min).

## Step 1: Create Your Account

**Time:** ~5–10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Get a Fiverr seller account and verify your email so you can create a profile and gigs.

### Sub-steps

1. Go to [fiverr.com](https://www.fiverr.com) and click **Join** (or **Sign Up**).
2. Sign up with **email** or **social login** (e.g. Google, Apple). Use an email you check regularly—Fiverr sends order and message notifications.
3. Verify your email by clicking the link Fiverr sends. Check spam if you don’t see it.
4. When prompted, choose **Seller** (or **I want to sell**) so Fiverr sets you up as a freelancer, not a buyer-only account.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Account created; [ ] Email verified; [ ] Seller mode selected

## Step 2: Complete Your Profile

**Time:** ~15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Add a professional photo, bio, and skills so buyers and the platform can trust and categorize you.

### Sub-step 2.1: Add a professional photo

1. Go to your profile (click your avatar or **Profile** in the menu).
2. Upload a **profile photo**. Use a clear headshot: neutral background, face visible, good lighting. Avoid logos or busy images for the main profile photo.
3. **Tip:** If you don’t have one, use a phone with good light or a simple Canva/AI-generated background (within Fiverr’s policies).

**AI tip:** Ask ChatGPT: *"Turn my bio into three short Fiverr profile bio options (1–2 lines each)."* Pick one and tweak.

### Sub-step 2.2: Write your bio

1. In your profile, find the **Bio** or **About** section.
2. Write 1–2 lines: who you help, what you deliver, and why they should choose you. Use your one-sentence positioning from the [Service Definition Framework](service-definition-framework.md) if you’ve completed it.
3. Stay within Fiverr’s character limit (check the counter). No spam, links to other platforms, or prohibited content.

### Sub-step 2.3: Set skills and language

1. In **Skills** (or **Seller profile**), add 2–3 skills that match your service (e.g. Logo Design, Copywriting, Video Editing). For Level 1, focus on a narrow set so you’re easy to find.
2. Set your **language(s)** and level (e.g. English – Fluent).

### Sub-step 2.4: Complete seller verification

1. If Fiverr prompts for **verification** (e.g. ID, phone), complete it. Verified sellers get higher trust and fewer restrictions.
2. Follow the on-screen steps and wait for confirmation (usually minutes to a day).

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Photo added; [ ] Bio written; [ ] Skills and language set; [ ] Verification completed (if prompted)

## Step 3: Create Your First Gig

**Time:** ~45–60 minutes per gig  
**Purpose:** Publish one gig with a clear title, description, pricing, delivery time, images, and FAQ so buyers can order.

### Sub-step 3.1: Choose category and subcategory

1. Click **Create a Gig** (or **Gig** > **Create New Gig**).
2. Choose the **category** and **subcategory** that best match your service (e.g. Graphics & Design > Logo Design). This affects where you appear in search.

### Sub-step 3.2: Write your gig title

1. Use the formula: **"I will [deliverable] for [niche]."** Example: "I will design a professional logo for small businesses."
2. Include your **primary keyword** (e.g. "logo design," "blog post") so buyers find you in search.
3. Stay within Fiverr’s **character limit** (e.g. 80 characters—check the counter).
4. **Best practice:** Avoid words like "best," "#1," or "guaranteed" if they violate Fiverr’s guidelines. Be clear and specific.

### Sub-step 3.3: Write your gig description

1. **Hook:** First 1–2 sentences should say what you deliver and who it’s for.
2. **Benefits:** Use bullet points for what the buyer gets (e.g. "Professional logo in multiple formats," "2 revision rounds").
3. **Process:** Briefly say how you work (e.g. "You send your brief; I deliver the first draft in X days").
4. **Call to action:** Invite them to order or message you.
5. Use the [Gig Listing Template](gig-listing-template.md) in this level for structure. **AI tip:** Paste your [Service Definition](service-definition-framework.md) into ChatGPT and ask for a Fiverr gig description (hook, bullets, CTA); then personalize.

### Sub-step 3.4: Set delivery time and revisions

1. **Delivery time:** Choose a number of days you can reliably meet (e.g. 3, 5, 7). Under-promise slightly so you can deliver on time.
2. **Revisions:** Set how many revision rounds are included (e.g. 1 or 2 for Level 1). This reduces scope creep; add more in higher tiers if you use packages.

### Sub-step 3.5: Set pricing (Basic / Standard / Premium or single)

1. Choose **single package** or **multiple packages** (Basic, Standard, Premium).
2. For each package: set **price**, **deliverables**, and **delivery time**. Align with your [Pricing Strategy Worksheet](pricing-strategy-worksheet.md).
3. Add **add-ons** if relevant (e.g. extra revision, rush delivery). Keep it simple for Level 1.

### Sub-step 3.6: Add gig images

1. **Minimum:** 1 image. **Recommended:** 3 images (e.g. sample work, process, or professional graphic).
2. Use clear, high-quality images. No watermarks that violate Fiverr’s rules. **AI tip:** Canva templates or AI image tools can help; always check Fiverr’s policies for allowed content.

### Sub-step 3.7: Add FAQ (3–5 questions)

1. In the gig editor, find **FAQ** and add 3–5 common questions, e.g.  
   - What do I need to provide?  
   - How many revisions are included?  
   - What’s the delivery time?  
   - What’s included in each package?
2. Write short, clear answers. **AI tip:** Paste your gig description into ChatGPT and ask for 5 buyer questions with short answers; then edit.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Category chosen; [ ] Title and description written; [ ] Delivery and revisions set; [ ] Pricing set; [ ] Images added; [ ] FAQ added

## Step 4: Optimize for Search

**Time:** ~15 minutes  
**Purpose:** Make your gig findable via keywords and tags so buyers can discover you.

### Sub-steps

1. **Search tags:** In your gig editor, add Fiverr’s **search tags** (keywords). Use the same terms as in your title and first line of description. Don’t repeat the same word; use variations (e.g. "logo," "brand identity," "logo design").
2. **Align title, description, and tags:** Your primary keyword should appear in the title and early in the description; tags should support (not duplicate) the same theme.
3. **Buyer Requests (if available):** Check Fiverr’s Buyer Requests (or equivalent) and send personalized offers when relevant. Don’t spam; tailor each response.
4. **Ongoing:** Maintain a high rating and on-time delivery—Fiverr’s algorithm favors reliable sellers over time.

**Testing checklist:** [ ] Tags added; [ ] Title/description/tags aligned; [ ] Buyer Requests checked (if available)
